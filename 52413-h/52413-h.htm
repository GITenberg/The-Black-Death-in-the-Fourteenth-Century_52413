<h2>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In reading Dr. Hecker’s account of the
Black Death which destroyed so large a
portion of the human race in the fourteenth
century, I was struck, not only with the
peculiarity of the Author’s views, but also
with the interesting nature of the facts
which he has collected. Some of these
have never before been made generally
known, while others have passed out of
mind, being effaced from our memories by
subsequent events of a similar kind, which,
though really of less magnitude and importance,
have, in the perspective of time,
appeared greater, because they have occurred
nearer to our own days.</p>

<p>Dreadful as was the pestilence here described,
and in few countries more so than
in England, our modern historians only
slightly allude to its visitation:&mdash;Hume<span class="pagenum" title="ii"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii"></a></span>
deems a single paragraph sufficient to devote
to its notice, and Henry and Rapin
are equally brief.</p>

<p>It may not then be unacceptable to the
medical, or even to the general reader, to
receive an authentic and somewhat detailed
account of one of the greatest natural calamities
that ever afflicted the human race.</p>

<p>My chief motive, however, for translating
this small work, and at this particular
period, has been a desire that, in the study
of the causes which have produced and
propagated general pestilences, and of the
moral effects by which they have been followed,
the most enlarged views should be
taken. The contagionist and the anti-contagionist
may each find ample support for
his belief in particular cases; but in the
construction of a theory sufficiently comprehensive
to explain throughout the origin
and dissemination of universal disease, we
shall not only perceive the insufficiency of
either doctrine, taken singly, but after admitting
the combined influence of both,<span class="pagenum" title="iii"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii"></a></span>
shall even then find our views too narrow,
and be compelled, in our endeavours to
explain the facts, to acknowledge the existence
of unknown powers, wholly unconnected
either with communication by contact
or atmospheric contamination.</p>

<p>I by no means wish it to be understood,
that I have adopted the author’s views respecting
astral and telluric influences, the
former of which, at least, I had supposed
to have been, with alchemy and magic, long
since consigned to oblivion; much less am
I prepared to accede to his notion, or rather
an ancient notion derived from the East and
revived by him, of an organic life in the
system of the universe. We are constantly
furnished with proofs, that that which
affects life is not itself alive; and whether
we look to the earth for exhalations, to the
air for electrical phenomena, to the heavenly
bodies for an influence over our planet, or
to all these causes combined, for the formation
of some unknown principle noxious
to animal existence, still, if we found our<span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span>
reasoning on ascertained facts, we can perceive
nothing throughout this vast field for
physical research which is not evidently
governed by the laws of inert matter,
nothing which resembles the regular succession
of birth, growth, decay, death, and
regeneration, observable in organized beings.
To assume, therefore, causes of whose existence
we have no proof, in order to account
for effects which, after all, they do
not explain, is making no real advance in
knowledge, and can scarcely be considered
otherwise than an indirect method of confessing
our ignorance.</p>

<p>Still, however, I regard the author’s
opinions, illustrated as they are by a series
of interesting facts diligently collected
from authentic sources, as, at least, worthy
of examination before we reject them, and
valuable, as furnishing extensive data on
which to build new theories.</p>

<p>I have another, perhaps I may be allowed
to say a better, motive for laying before my
countrymen this narrative of the sufferings<span class="pagenum" title="v"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a></span>
of past ages,&mdash;that by comparing them with
those of our own time, we may be made
the more sensible how lightly the chastening
hand of Providence has fallen on the
present generation, and how much reason,
therefore, we have to feel grateful for the
mercy shewn us.</p>

<p>The publication has, with this view, been
purposely somewhat delayed, in order that
it might appear at a moment when it is to
be presumed that men’s thoughts will be
especially directed to the approaching hour
of public thanksgiving, and when a knowledge
of that which they have escaped, as
well as of that which they have suffered,
may tend to heighten their devotional
feelings on that solemn occasion.</p>

<p>When we learn that, in the fourteenth
century, one quarter, at least, of the population
of the old world was swept away in
the short space of four years, and that some
countries, England among the rest, lost
more than double that proportion of their
inhabitants in the course of a few months,<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
we may well congratulate ourselves that
our visitation has not been like theirs, and
shall not justly merit ridicule, if we offer
our humble thanks to the “Creator and
Preserver of all mankind” for our deliverance.</p>

<p>Nor would it disgrace our feelings, if, in
expiation of the abuse and obloquy not long
since so lavishly bestowed by the public, we
should entertain some slight sense of gratitude
towards those members of the community,
who were engaged, at the risk of
their lives and the sacrifice of their personal
interests, in endeavouring to arrest the progress
of the evil, and to mitigate the sufferings
of their fellow men.</p>

<p>I have added, at the close of the Appendix,
some extracts from a scarce little work
in black letter, called “A Boke or Counseill
against the Disease commonly called the
Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse,” published
by Caius in 1552. This was written three
years before his Latin treatise on the same
subject, and is so quaint, and, at the same<span class="pagenum" title="vii"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span>
time, so illustrative of the opinions of his
day, and even of those of the fourteenth century,
on the causes of universal diseases, that
the passages which I have quoted will not
fail to afford some amusement as well as instruction.
If I have been tempted to reprint
more of this curious production than was
necessary to my primary object, it has been
from a belief that it would be generally acceptable
to the reader to gather some particulars
regarding the mode of living in the sixteenth
century, and to observe the author’s
animadversions on the degeneracy and credulity
of the age in which he lived. His
advice on the choice of a medical attendant
cannot be too strongly recommended, at
least <i>by a physician</i>; and his warning against
quackery, particularly the quackery of
<i>painters</i>, who “scorne (<i>quære</i> score?) you
behind your backs with their medicines, so
filthy that I am ashamed to name them,”
seems quite prophetic.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I beg to acknowledge the
obligation which I owe to my friend Mr.<span class="pagenum" title="viii"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span>
H. E. Lloyd, whose intimate acquaintance
with the German language and literature
will, I hope, be received as a sufficient
pledge that no very important errors remain
in a translation which he has kindly
revised.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>We here find an important page of the
history of the world laid open to our view.
It treats of a convulsion of the human race,
unequalled in violence and extent. It
speaks of incredible disasters, of despair
and unbridled demoniacal passions. It
shews us the abyss of general licentiousness,
in consequence of an universal pestilence,
which extended from China to Iceland and
Greenland.</p>

<p>The inducement to unveil this image of
an age, long since gone by, is evident. A
new pestilence has attained almost an equal
extent, and though less formidable, has
partly produced, partly indicated, similar
phenomena. Its causes and its diffusion
over Asia and Europe, call on us to take a
comprehensive view of it, because it leads to
an insight into the organism of the world, in<span class="pagenum" title="x"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a></span>
which the sum of organic life is subject to
the great powers of Nature. Now, human
knowledge is not yet sufficiently advanced,
to discover the connexion between the
processes which occur above, and those
which occur below, the surface of the earth,
or even fully to explore the laws of nature,
an acquaintance with which would be required,
far less to apply them to great phenomena,
in which one spring sets a thousand
others in motion.</p>

<p>On this side, therefore, such a point of
view is not to be found, if we would not lose
ourselves in the wilderness of conjectures,
of which the world is already too full: but
it may be found in the ample and productive
field of historical research.</p>

<p>History&mdash;that mirror of human life in all
its bearings, offers, even for general pestilences,
an inexhaustible, though scarcely
explored, mine of facts; here too it asserts
its dignity, as the philosophy of reality delighting
in truth.</p>

<p>It is conformable to its spirit to conceive<span class="pagenum" title="xi"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a></span>
general pestilences as events affecting the
whole world, to explain their occurrences
by the comparison of what is similar, by
which the facts speak for themselves, because
they appear to have proceeded from
the higher laws which govern the progression
of the existence of mankind. A
cosmical origin and convulsive excitement,
productive of the most important
consequences among the nations subject to
them, are the most striking features to which
history points in all general pestilences.
The latter, however, assume very different
forms, as well in their attacks on the general
organism, as in their diffusion; and in this
respect a development from form to form,
in the course of centuries, is manifest, so
that the history of the world is divided into
grand periods in which positively defined
pestilences prevailed. As far as our chronicles
extend, more or less certain information
can be obtained respecting them.</p>

<p>But this part of medical history, which
has such a manifold and powerful influence<span class="pagenum" title="xii"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a></span>
over the history of the world, is yet in its infancy.
For the honor of that science which
should everywhere guide the actions of mankind,
we are induced to express a wish, that
it may find room to flourish amidst the rank
vegetation with which the field of German

<p class="tac fs240 mb1em">THE BLACK DEATH.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Observations.</span></h3>


<p>That Omnipotence which has called
the world with all its living creatures into
one animated being, especially reveals himself
in the desolation of great pestilences.
The powers of creation come into violent
collision; the sultry dryness of the atmosphere;
the subterraneous thunders; the mist
of overflowing waters, are the harbingers of
destruction. Nature is not satisfied with
the ordinary alternations of life and death,
and the Destroying Angel waves over man
and beast his flaming sword.</p>

<p>These revolutions are performed in vast
cycles, which the spirit of man, limited as<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
it is, to a narrow circle of perception, is unable
to explore. They are, however, greater
terrestrial events than any of those which
proceed from the discord, the distress or
the passions of nations. By annihilations
they awaken new life; and when the tumult
above and below the earth is past, nature
is renovated, and the mind awakens from
torpor and depression to the consciousness
of an intellectual existence.</p>

<p>Were it in any degree within the power
of human research to draw up, in a vivid
and connected form, an historical sketch
of such mighty events, after the manner of
the historians of wars and battles, and the
migrations of nations, we might then arrive
at clear views with respect to the mental
development of the human race, and the
ways of Providence would be more plainly
discernible. It would then be demonstrable,
that the mind of nations is deeply affected
by the destructive conflict of the powers
of nature, and that great disasters lead to
striking changes in general civilization. For<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
all that exists in man, whether good or evil,
is rendered conspicuous by the presence
of great danger. His inmost feelings are
roused&mdash;the thought of self-preservation
masters his spirit&mdash;self denial is put to
severe proof, and wherever darkness and
barbarism prevail, there the affrighted
mortal flies to the idols of his superstition,
and all laws, human and divine, are
criminally violated.</p>

<p>In conformity with a general law of
nature, such a state of excitement, brings
about a change, beneficial or detrimental,
according to circumstances, so that nations
either attain a higher degree of moral
worth, or sink deeper in ignorance and
vice. All this, however, takes place upon
a much grander scale than through the
ordinary vicissitudes of war and peace,
or the rise and fall of empires, because
the powers of nature themselves produce
plagues, and subjugate the human will,
which, in the contentions of nations, alone
predominates.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Disease.</span></h3>


<p>The most memorable example of what
has been advanced, is afforded by a great
pestilence of the fourteenth century, which
desolated Asia, Europe, and Africa, and of
which the people yet preserve the remembrance
in gloomy traditions. It was an
oriental plague, marked by inflammatory
boils and tumors of the glands, such as
break out in no other febrile disease. On
account of these inflammatory boils, and
from the black spots, indicatory of a putrid
decomposition, which appeared upon the
skin, it was called in Germany and in the
northern kingdoms of Europe, <i>the Black
Death</i>, and in Italy, la Mortalega Grande,
<i>the Great Mortality</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>
<p>Few testimonies are presented to us respecting
its symptoms and its course, yet
these are sufficient to throw light upon the
form of the malady, and they are worthy of
credence, from their coincidence with the
signs of the same disease in modern times.</p>

<p>The imperial writer, Kantakusenos<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
whose own son, Andronikus, died of this<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
plague in Constantinople, notices great
<span class="nowrap">imposthumes<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> of the thighs and arms
of those affected, which, when opened,
afforded relief by the discharge of an offensive
matter. Buboes, which are the infallible
signs of the oriental plague, are thus
plainly indicated, for he makes separate
mention of smaller boils on the arms and in
the face, as also in other parts of the body,
and clearly distinguishes these from the
blisters<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> which are no less produced by
plague in all its forms. In many cases,
black <span class="nowrap">spots<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> broke out all over the body,
either single, or united and confluent.</p>

<p>These symptoms were not all found in
every case. In many, one alone was sufficient
to cause death, while some patients recovered,
contrary to expectation, though afflicted
with all. Symptoms of cephalic affection
were frequent; many patients became
stupified and fell into a deep sleep, losing<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
also their speech from palsy of the tongue;
others remained sleepless and without rest.
The fauces and tongue were black, and as if
suffused with blood; no beverage would assuage
their burning thirst, so that their
sufferings continued without alleviation until
terminated by death, which many in their
despair accelerated with their own hands.
Contagion was evident, for attendants
caught the disease of their relations and
friends, and many houses in the capital
were bereft even of their last inhabitant.
Thus far the ordinary circumstances only
of the oriental plague occurred. Still
deeper sufferings, however, were connected
with this pestilence, such as have not
been felt at other times; the organs of
respiration were seized with a putrid inflammation;
a violent pain in the chest
attacked the patient; blood was expectorated,
and the breath diffused a pestiferous
odour.</p>

<p>In the West, the following were the
predominating symptoms on the eruption<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
of this disease<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> An ardent fever, accompanied
by an evacuation of blood,
proved fatal in the first three days. It
appears that buboes and inflammatory boils
did not at first come out at all, but that
the disease, in the form of carbuncular
(<i>anthraxartigen</i>) affection of the lungs,
effected the destruction of life before the
other symptoms were developed.</p>

<p>Thus did the plague rage in Avignon for
six or eight weeks, and the pestilential
breath of the sick, who expectorated blood,
caused a terrible contagion far and near;
for even the vicinity of those who had
fallen ill of plague was certain death<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>
so that parents abandoned their infected
children, and all the ties of kindred
were dissolved. After this period, buboes<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
in the axilla and in the groin, and inflammatory
boils all over the body, made
their appearance; but it was not until
seven months afterwards that some patients
recovered with matured buboes, as in the
ordinary milder form of plague.</p>

<p>Such is the report of the courageous
Guy de Chauliac, who vindicated the
honor of medicine, by bidding defiance
to danger; boldly and constantly assisting
the affected, and disdaining the excuse
of his colleagues, who held the Arabian
notion, that medical aid was unavailing,
and that the contagion justified flight.
He saw the plague twice in Avignon,
first in the year 1348, from January to
August, and then twelve years later, in
the autumn, when it returned from Germany,
and for nine months spread general
distress and terror. The first time it
raged chiefly among the poor, but in the<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
year 1360, more among the higher classes.
It now also destroyed a great many
children, whom it had formerly spared,
and but few women.</p>

<p>The like was seen in Egypt<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> Here
also inflammation of the lungs was predominant,
and destroyed quickly and
infallibly, with burning heat and expectoration
of blood. Here too the breath of the
sick spread a deadly contagion, and human
aid was as vain as it was destructive to
those who approached the infected.</p>

<p>Boccacio, who was an eye-witness of
its incredible fatality in Florence, the
seat of the revival of science, gives a
more lively description of the attack of
the disease than his non-medical contemporaries<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>It commenced here, not as in the East,
with bleeding at the nose, a sure sign<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
of inevitable death; but there took place
at the beginning, both in men and women,
tumours in the groin and in the axilla,
varying in circumference up to the size
of an apple or an egg, and called by
the people, pest-boils (gavoccioli). Then
there appeared similar tumours indiscriminately
over all parts of the body, and
black or blue spots came out on the
arms or thighs, or on other parts, either
single and large, or small and thickly
studded. These spots proved equally
fatal with the pest-boils, which had been
from the first regarded as a sure sign of
death<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> No power of medecine brought
relief&mdash;almost all died within the first three
days, some sooner, some later, after the appearance
of these signs, and for the most
part entirely without <span class="nowrap">fever<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> or other symptoms.
The plague spread itself with the
greater fury, as it communicated from the<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
sick to the healthy, like fire among dry
and oily fuel, and even contact with the
clothes and other articles which had been
used by the infected, seemed to induce the
disease. As it advanced, not only men,
but animals fell sick and shortly expired,
if they had touched things belonging to the
diseased or dead. Thus Boccacio himself
saw two hogs on the rags of a person who
had died of plague, after staggering about
for a short time, fall down dead, as if they
had taken poison. In other places, multitudes
of dogs, cats, fowls and other animals,
fell victims to the contagion<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> and
it is to be presumed that other epizootes
among animals likewise took place, although
the ignorant writers of the fourteenth
century are silent on this point.</p>

<p>In Germany there was a repetition in
every respect of the same phenomena. The<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
infallible signs of the oriental bubo-plague
with its inevitable contagion were found
there as everywhere else; but the mortality
was not nearly so great as in the
other parts of Europe<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> The accounts do
not all make mention of the spitting of blood,
the diagnostic symptom of this fatal pestilence;
we are not, however, thence to
conclude that there was any considerable
mitigation or modification of the disease,
for we must not only take into account the
defectiveness of the chronicles, but that
isolated testimonies are often contradicted
by many others. Thus, the chronicles of
Strasburg, which only take notice of boils
and glandular swellings in the axillæ and
groins<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> are opposed by another account,<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
according to which the mortal spitting of
blood was met with in Germany<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> but this
again is rendered suspicious, as the narrator
postpones the death of those who were thus
affected, to the sixth, and (even the) eighth
day, whereas, no other author sanctions so
long a course of the disease; and even in Strasburg,
where a mitigation of the plague may,
with most probability, be assumed, since in
the year 1349, only 16,000 people were
carried off, the generality expired by the third
or fourth day<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> In Austria, and especially in
Vienna, the plague was fully as malignant
as any where, so that the patients who had
red spots and black boils, as well as those
afflicted with tumid glands, died about the
third day<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> and lastly, very frequent sudden<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
deaths occurred on the coasts of the North
Sea and in Westphalia, without any further
development of the malady<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>To France, this plague came in a northern
direction from Avignon, and was there more
destructive than in Germany, so that in
many places not more than two in twenty
of the inhabitants survived. Many were
struck, as if by lightning, and died on the
spot, and this more frequently among the
young and strong than the old; patients
with enlarged glands in the axillæ and
groins scarcely survived two or three days;
and no sooner did these fatal signs appear,
than they bid adieu to the world, and
sought consolation only in the absolution
which Pope Clement VI. promised them
in the hour of death<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>In England the malady appeared, as at
Avignon, with spitting of blood, and with
the same fatality, so that the sick who were<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
afflicted either with this symptom or with
vomiting of blood, died in some cases immediately,
in others within twelve hours, or at
the latest, in two days<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> The inflammatory
boils and buboes in the groins and axillæ were
recognised at once as prognosticating a fatal
issue, and those were past all hope of recovery
in whom they arose in numbers all
over the body. It was not till towards the
close of the plague that they ventured to
open, by incision, these hard and dry boils,
when matter flowed from them in small
quantity, and thus, by compelling nature to
a critical suppuration, many patients were
saved. Every spot which the sick had
touched, their breath, their clothes, spread
the contagion; and, as in all other places,
the attendants and friends who were either
blind to their danger or heroically despised
it, fell a sacrifice to their sympathy. Even
the eyes of the patient were considered as<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
sources of contagion<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> which had the power
of acting at a distance, whether on account
of their unwonted lustre or the distortion
which they always suffer in plague, or
whether in conformity with an ancient
notion, according to which the sight was
considered as the bearer of a demoniacal
enchantment. Flight from infected cities
seldom availed the fearful, for the germ of
the disease adhered to them, and they fell
sick, remote from assistance, in the solitude
of their country houses.</p>

<p>Thus did the plague spread over England
with unexampled rapidity, after it had
first broken out in the county of Dorset,
whence it advanced through the counties of
Devon and Somerset, to Bristol, and thence
reached Gloucester, Oxford and London.
Probably few places escaped, perhaps
not any; for the annals of contemporaries
report, that throughout the land only a<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
tenth part of the inhabitants remained
alive<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span></p>

<p>From England the contagion was carried
by a ship to Bergen, the capital of Norway,
where the plague then broke out in its most
frightful form, with vomiting of blood; and
throughout the whole country, spared not
more than a third of the inhabitants. The
sailors found no refuge in their ships; and
vessels were often seen driving about on
the ocean and drifting on shore, whose crews
had perished to the last man<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>
<p>In Poland the infected were attacked
with spitting of blood, and died in a few
days in such vast numbers, that, as it has
been affirmed, scarcely a fourth of the
inhabitants were left<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, in Russia the plague appeared
two years later than in Southern Europe;
yet here again, with the same symptoms as
elsewhere. Russian contemporaries have
recorded that it began with rigor, heat,
and darting pain in the shoulders and back;
that it was accompanied by spitting of
blood, and terminated fatally in two, or at
most, three days. It is not till the year
1360, that we find buboes mentioned as
occurring in the neck, in the axillæ and
in the groins, which are stated to have
broken out when the spitting of blood
had continued some time. According to
the experience of Western Europe, however,
it cannot be assumed that these<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
symptoms did not appear at an earlier
period<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<p>Thus much, from authentic sources, on the
nature of the Black Death. The descriptions
which have been communicated contain,
with a few unimportant exceptions, all the
symptoms of the oriental plague which
have been observed in more modern times.
No doubt can obtain on this point. The
facts are placed clearly before our eyes.
We must, however, bear in mind, that this
violent disease does not always appear in
the same form, and that while the essence
of the poison which it produces, and which
is separated so abundantly from the body
of the patient, remains unchanged, it
is proteiform in its varieties, from the
almost imperceptible vesicle, unaccompanied
by fever, which exists for some time<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
before it extends its poison inwardly, and
then excites fever and buboes, to the fatal
form in which carbuncular inflammations
fall upon the most important viscera.</p>

<p>Such was the form which the plague
assumed in the 14th century, for the accompanying
chest affection which appeared in
all the countries whereof we have received
any account, cannot, on a comparison with
similar and familiar symptoms, be considered
as any other than the inflammation of the
lungs of modern medicine<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> a disease which
at present only appears sporadically, and,
owing to a putrid decomposition of the
fluids, is probably combined with hemorrhages
from the vessels of the lungs. Now,
as every carbuncle, whether it be cutaneous
or internal, generates in abundance
the matter of contagion which has given rise
to it, so, therefore, must the breath of the
affected have been poisonous in this plague,<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
and on this account its power of contagion
wonderfully increased; wherefore the
opinion appears incontrovertible, that owing
to the accumulated numbers of the diseased,
not only individual chambers and houses,
but whole cities were infected, which, moreover,
in the middle ages, were, with few
exceptions, narrowly built, kept in a filthy
state, and surrounded with stagnant ditches<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>
Flight was, in consequence, of no avail to
the timid; for even though they had sedulously
avoided all communication with the
diseased and the suspected, yet their clothes
were saturated with the pestiferous atmosphere,
and every inspiration imparted to them
the seeds of the destructive malady, which,
in the greater number of cases, germinated
with but too much fertility. Add to which,
the usual propagation of the plague through
clothes, beds, and a thousand other things<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
to which the pestilential poison adheres,&mdash;a
propagation, which, from want of caution,
must have been infinitely multiplied; and
since articles of this kind, removed from the
access of air, not only retain the matter of
contagion for an indefinite period, but also
increase its activity and engender it like
a living being, frightful ill-consequences
followed for many years after the first fury
of the pestilence was past.</p>

<p>The affection of the stomach, often mentioned
in vague terms, and occasionally as
a vomiting of blood, was doubtless only a
subordinate symptom, even if it be admitted
that actual hematemesis did occur. For the
difficulty of distinguishing a flow of blood
from the stomach, from a pulmonic expectoration
of that fluid, is, to non-medical men,
even in common cases, not inconsiderable.
How much greater then must it have been in
so terrible a disease, where assistants could
not venture to approach the sick without exposing
themselves to certain death? Only
two medical descriptions of the malady have<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
reached us, the one by the brave <i>Guy de
Chauliac</i>, the other by <i>Raymond Chalin de
Vinario</i>, a very experienced scholar, who
was well versed in the learning of his
time. The former takes notice only of
fatal coughing of blood; the latter, besides
this, notices epistaxis, hematuria
and fluxes of blood from the bowels, as
symptoms of such decided and speedy
mortality, that those patients in whom they
were observed, usually died on the same or
the following day<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span></p>
<p>That a vomiting of blood may not, here
and there, have taken place, perhaps have
been even prevalent in many places, is,
from a consideration of the nature of the
disease, by no means to be denied; for
every putrid decomposition of the fluids,
begets a tendency to hemorrhages of all
kinds. Here, however, it is a question
of historical certainty, which, after these
doubts, is by no means established. Had not
so speedy a death followed the expectoration
of blood, we should certainly have received
more detailed intelligence respecting other
hemorrhages; but the malady had no time
to extend its effects further over the extremities
of the vessels. After its first fury,
however, was spent, the pestilence passed
into the usual febrile form of the oriental
plague. Internal, carbuncular inflammations
no longer took place, and hemorrhages
became phenomena, no more essential
in this than they are in any other febrile
disorders. Chalin, who observed not only
the <i>great mortality</i> of 1348, and the plague<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
of 1360, but also that of 1373 and 1382,
speaks moreover of <i>affections of the throat</i>,
and describes the <i>black spots</i> of plague
patients more satisfactorily than any of his
cotemporaries. The former appeared but
in few cases, and consisted in carbuncular
inflammation of the gullet, with a difficulty
of swallowing, even to suffocation, to which,
in some instances, was added inflammation
of the ceruminous glands of the ears, with
tumours, producing great deformity. Such
patients, as well as others, were affected
with expectoration of blood; but they did
not usually die before the sixth, and sometimes,
even so late as the fourteenth day<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span>
The same occurrence, it is well known, is
not uncommon in other pestilences; as also
blisters on the surface of the body, in different
places, in the vicinity of which, tumid
glands and inflammatory boils, surrounded<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
by discoloured and black streaks, arose, and
thus indicated the reception of the poison.
These streaked spots were called, by an
apt comparison, <i>the girdle</i>, and this appearance
was justly considered extremely
dangerous<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="lowercase smcap">CAUSES.&mdash;SPREAD.</span></h3>


<p>An enquiry into the causes of the Black
Death, will not be without important results
in the study of the plagues which
have visited the world, although it cannot
advance beyond generalisation without
entering upon a field hitherto uncultivated,
and, to this hour, entirely unknown. Mighty
revolutions in the organism of the earth,
of which we have credible information,
had preceded it. From China to the
Atlantic, the foundations of the earth were
shaken,&mdash;throughout Asia and Europe the
atmosphere was in commotion, and endangered,
by its baneful influence, both
vegetable and animal life.</p>

<p>The series of these great events began
in the year 1333, fifteen years before the<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
plague broke out in Europe: they first
appeared in China. Here a parching
drought, accompanied by famine, commenced
in the tract of country watered
by the rivers Kiang and Hoai. This
was followed by such violent torrents of
rain, in and about Kingsai, at that time
the capital of the Empire, that, according
to tradition, more than 400,000
people perished in the floods. Finally,
the mountain Tsincheou fell in, and vast
clefts were formed in the earth. In the
succeeding year (1334), passing over fabulous
traditions, the neighbourhood of
Canton was visited by inundations; whilst
in Tche, after an unexampled drought, a
plague arose, which is said to have carried
off about 5,000,000 of people. A
few months afterwards an earthquake
followed, at and near Kingsai; and subsequent
to the falling in of the mountains
of Ki-ming-chan, a lake was formed of
more than a hundred leagues in circumference,
where, again, thousands found their<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
grave. In Hou-kouang and Ho-nan, a
drought prevailed for five months; and
innumerable swarms of locusts destroyed
the vegetation; while famine and pestilence,
as usual, followed in their train. Connected
accounts of the condition of Europe
before this great catastrophe, are not to
be expected from the writers of the
fourteenth century. It is remarkable,
however, that simultaneously with a
drought and renewed floods in China,
in 1336, many uncommon atmospheric
phenomena, and in the winter, frequent
thunder storms, were observed in the
north of France; and so early as the
eventful year of 1333, an eruption of
Etna took place<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> According to the
Chinese annals, about 4,000,000 of people
perished by famine in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
of Kiang in 1337; and deluges, swarms
of locusts, and an earthquake which
lasted six days, caused incredible devastation.
In the same year, the first
swarms of locusts appeared in Franconia,
which were succeeded in the following
year by myriads of these insects. In
1338, Kingsai was visited by an earthquake
of ten days duration; at the same
time France suffered from a failure in
the harvest; and thenceforth, till the
year 1342, there was in China, a constant
succession of inundations, earthquakes,
and famines. In the same year great floods
occurred in the vicinity of the Rhine
and in France, which could not be
attributed to rain alone; for, everywhere,
even on the tops of mountains, springs
were seen to burst forth, and dry tracts
were laid under water in an inexplicable
manner. In the following year, the
mountain Hong-tchang, in China, fell in,
and caused a destructive deluge; and
in Pien-tcheou and Leang-tcheou, after<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
three months’ rain, there followed unheard
of inundations, which destroyed seven
cities. In Egypt and Syria, violent earthquakes
took place; and in China they
became, from this time, more and more
frequent; for they recurred, in 1344, in
Ven-tcheou, where the sea overflowed in
consequence; in 1345, in Ki-tcheou, and
in both the following years in Canton,
with subterraneous thunder. Meanwhile,
floods and famine devastated various districts,
until 1347, when the fury of the
elements subsided in China<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<p>The signs of terrestrial commotions
commenced in Europe in the year 1348,
after the intervening districts of country
in Asia had probably been visited in
the same manner.</p>

<p>On the island of Cyprus, the plague from
the East had already broken out; when
an earthquake shook the foundations of
the island, and was accompanied by so<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
frightful a hurricane, that the inhabitants
who had slain their Mahometan slaves, in
order that they might not themselves be
subjugated by them, fled in dismay, in
all directions. The sea overflowed&mdash;the
ships were dashed to pieces on the rocks,
and few outlived the terrific event, whereby
this fertile and blooming island was
converted into a desert. Before the earthquake,
a pestiferous wind spread so poisonous
an odour, that many, being overpowered
by it, fell down suddenly and
expired in dreadful agonies<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p>This phenomenon is one of the rarest
that has ever been observed, for nothing
is more constant than the composition of
the air; and in no respect has nature
been more careful in the preservation of
organic life. Never have naturalists discovered
in the atmosphere, foreign elements,
which, evident to the senses, and
borne by the winds, spread from land to<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
land, carrying disease over whole portions
of the earth, as is recounted to have taken
place in the year 1348. It is, therefore,
the more to be regretted, that in this extraordinary
period, which, owing to the low
condition of science, was very deficient
in accurate observers, so little that can
be depended on respecting those uncommon
occurrences in the air, should have
been recorded. Yet, German accounts say
expressly, that a thick, stinking mist advanced
from the East, and spread itself
over Italy<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> and there could be no de<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>ception
in so palpable a phenomenon<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>
The credibility of unadorned traditions,
however little they may satisfy to physical
research, can scarcely be called
in question when we consider the connexion
of events; for just at this time
earthquakes were more general than they
had been within the range of history.
In thousands of places chasms were
formed, from whence arose noxious vapours;
and as at that time natural occurrences
were transformed into miracles,
it was reported, that a fiery meteor,
which descended on the earth far in
the East, had destroyed every thing
within a circumference of more than a
hundred leagues, infecting the air far<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
and wide<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> The consequences of innumerable
floods contributed to the same
effect; vast river districts had been
converted into swamps; foul vapours
arose every where, increased by the odour
of putrified locusts, which had never perhaps
darkened the sun in thicker swarms<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
and of countless corpses, which even
in the well-regulated countries of Europe,
they knew not how to remove quickly
enough out of the sight of the living.
It is probable, therefore, that the atmosphere
contained foreign, and sensibly
perceptible, admixtures to a great extent,
which, at least in the lower regions,
could not be decomposed, or rendered
ineffective by separation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span></p>

<p>Now, if we go back to the symptoms
of the disease, the ardent inflammation
of the lungs points out, that the
organs of respiration yielded to the attack
of an atmospheric poison&mdash;a poison, which
(if we admit the independent origin of the
Black Plague at any one place on the
globe, which, under such extraordinary
circumstances, it would be difficult to
doubt,) attacked the course of the circulation
in as hostile a manner as that which
produces inflammation of the spleen and
other animal contagions that cause swelling
and inflammation of the lymphatic
glands.</p>

<p>Pursuing the course of these grand
revolutions further, we find notice of an
unexampled earthquake, which, on the
25th of January, 1348, shook Greece,
Italy and the neighbouring countries.
Naples, Rome, Pisa, Bologna, Padua,
Venice and many other cities suffered considerably:
whole villages were swallowed
up. Castles, houses and churches, were<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
overthrown, and hundreds of people were
buried beneath their ruins<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> In Carinthia,
thirty villages, together with all the
churches, were demolished; more than a
thousand corpses were drawn out of the
rubbish; the city of Villach was so completely
destroyed, that very few of its
inhabitants were saved; and when the
earth ceased to tremble, it was found that
mountains had been moved from their
positions, and that many hamlets were left
in ruins<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> It is recorded, that during this
earthquake, the wine in the casks became
turbid, a statement which may be considered
as furnishing a proof, that changes
causing a decomposition of the atmosphere
had taken place; but if we had no other
information from which the excitement
of conflicting powers of nature during<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
these commotions, might be inferred, yet
scientific observations in modern times
have shewn, that the relation of the atmosphere
to the earth is changed by volcanic
influences. Why then, may we not, from
this fact, draw retrospective inferences respecting
those extraordinary phenomena?</p>

<p>Independently of this, however, we know
that during this earthquake, the duration
of which is stated by some to have been
a week, and by others, a fortnight, people
experienced an unusual stupor and headache,
and that many fainted away<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span></p>

<p>These destructive earthquakes extended
as far as the neighbourhood of Basle<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> and
recurred until the year 1360, throughout
Germany, France, Silesia, Poland, England
and Denmark, and much further north<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>Great and extraordinary meteors appeared
in many places, and were regarded
with superstitious horror. A pillar of fire,
which on the 20th of December, 1348,
remained for an hour at sun rise over the
pope’s palace in Avignon<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> a fireball,
which in August of the same year was
seen at sunset over Paris, and was distinguished
from similar phenomena, by its
longer duration<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> (not to mention other
instances mixed up with wonderful prophecies
and omens), are recorded in the
chronicles of that age.</p>

<p>The order of the seasons seemed to be inverted,&mdash;rains,
floods and failures in crops<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
were so general, that few places were
exempt from them; and though an historian
of this century assures us, that there
was an abundance in the granaries and
storehouses<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> all his contemporaries, with
one voice, contradict him. The consequences
of failure in the crops were soon
felt, especially in Italy and the surrounding
countries, where, in this year, a rain which
continued for four months, had destroyed
the seed. In the larger cities, they were
compelled, in the spring of 1347, to have
recourse to a distribution of bread among
the poor, particularly at Florence, where
they erected large bake-houses, from which,
in April, ninety-four thousand loaves of
bread, each of twelve ounces in weight,
were daily dispensed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> It is plain,
however, that humanity could only partially
mitigate the general distress, not
altogether obviate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>

<p>Diseases, the invariable consequence
of famine, broke out in the country, as
well as in cities; children died of hunger
in their mothers’ arms,&mdash;want, misery
and despair, were general throughout
Christendom<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the events which took place
before the eruption of the Black Plague in
Europe. Contemporaries have explained
them after their own manner, and have
thus, like their posterity, under similar
circumstances, given a proof, that mortals
possess neither senses nor intellectual
powers sufficiently acute to comprehend
the phenomena produced by the earth’s
organism, much less scientifically to understand
their effects. Superstition, selfishness
in a thousand forms, the presumption
of the schools, laid hold of unconnected<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
facts. They vainly thought to comprehend
the whole in the individual, and perceived
not the universal spirit which, in intimate
union with the mighty powers of nature, animates
the movements of all existence, and
permits not any phenomenon to originate
from isolated causes. To attempt, five
centuries after that age of desolation, to
point out the causes of a cosmical commotion,
which has never recurred to an
equal extent,&mdash;to indicate scientifically the
influences which called forth so terrific a
poison in the bodies of men and animals,
exceeds the limits of human understanding.
If we are even now unable, with
all the varied resources of an extended
knowledge of nature, to define that condition
of the atmosphere by which pestilences
are generated, still less can we pretend
to reason retrospectively from the nineteenth
to the fourteenth century; but if
we take a general view of the occurrences,
that century will give us copious infor<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>mation,
and, as applicable to all succeeding
times, of high importance.</p>

<p>In the progress of connected natural
phenomena, from East to West, that great
law of nature is plainly revealed which
has so often and evidently manifested itself
in the earth’s organism, as well as in the
state of nations dependent upon it. In
the inmost depths of the globe, that impulse
was given in the year 1333, which
in uninterrupted succession for six-and-twenty
years shook the surface of the
earth, even to the western shores of Europe.
From the very beginning the air partook
of the terrestrial concussion, atmospherical
waters overflowed the land, or its plants
and animals perished under the scorching heat.
The insect tribe was wonderfully
called into life, as if animated beings
were destined to complete the destruction
which astral and telluric powers had
begun. Thus did this dreadful work of
nature advance from year to year; it was a<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
progressive infection of the Zones which
exerted a powerful influence both above
and beneath the surface of the earth; and
after having been perceptible in slighter
indications, at the commencement of the
terrestrial commotions in China, convulsed
the whole earth.</p>

<p>The nature of the first plague in China
is unknown. We have no certain intelligence
of the disease, until it entered
the western countries of Asia. Here it
shewed itself as the oriental plague with
inflammation of the lungs; in which form
it probably also may have begun in China,
that is to say, as a malady which spreads,
more than any other, by contagion&mdash;a
contagion, that, in ordinary pestilences, requires
immediate contact, and only under
unfavorable circumstances of rare occurrence
is communicated by the mere approach
to the sick. The share which this
cause had in the spreading of the plague
over the whole earth, was certainly very
great: and the opinion that the Black<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
Death might have been excluded from
Western Europe, by good regulations, similar
to those which are now in use, would
have all the support of modern experience;
provided it could be proved that this plague
had been actually imported from the East;
or that the oriental plague in general, as
often as it appears in Europe, always has
its origin in Asia or Egypt. Such a proof,
however, cannot be produced so as to enforce
conviction; for it would involve the
impossible assumption, that either there
is no essential difference in the degree
of civilization of the European nations,
in the most ancient and in modern
times, or that detrimental circumstances,
which have yielded only to the civilization
of human society and the regular
cultivation of countries, could not formerly
have maintained the bubo-plague.</p>

<p>The plague was, however, known
in Europe before nations were united
by the bonds of commerce and social<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
intercourse<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> hence there is ground
for supposing that it sprung up spontaneously,
in consequence of the rude
manner of living and the uncultivated
state of the earth; influences which peculiarly
favor the origin of severe diseases.
Now, we need not go back to the earlier
centuries, for the 14th itself, before
it was half expired, was visited by five
or six pestilences<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span></p>

<p>If, therefore, we consider the peculiar
property of the plague, that, in countries
which it has once visited, it remains for<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
a long time in a milder form, and that the
epidemic influences of 1342, when it had
appeared for the last time, were particularly
favorable to its unperceived continuance,
till 1348, we come to the notion, that in this
eventful year also, the germs of plague
existed in Southern Europe, which might
be vivified by atmospherical deteriorations;
and that thus, at least in part, the Black
Plague may have originated in Europe itself.
The corruption of the atmosphere came from
the East; but the disease itself came not
upon the wings of the wind, but was only
excited and increased by the atmosphere
where it had previously existed.</p>

<p>This source of the Black Plague was
not, however, the only one; for, far more
powerful than the excitement of the latent
elements of the plague by atmospheric
influences, was the effect of the contagion
communicated from one people to another,
on the great roads, and in the harbours
of the Mediterranean. From China, the
route of the caravans lay to the north of<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
the Caspian Sea, through Central Asia, to
Tauris. Here ships were ready to take
the produce of the East to Constantinople,
the capital of commerce, and the medium
of connexion between Asia, Europe and
Africa<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> Other caravans went from India
to Asia Minor, and touched at the cities
south of the Caspian Sea, and lastly, from
Bagdad, through Arabia to Egypt; also
the maritime communication on the Red
Sea, from India to Arabia and Egypt,
was not inconsiderable. In all these directions
contagion made its way; and doubtless,
Constantinople and the harbours of
Asia Minor, are to be regarded as the foci
of infection; whence it radiated to the
most distant seaports and islands.</p>

<p>To Constantinople, the plague had been
brought from the northern coast of the
Black Sea<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> after it had depopulated the<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
countries between those routes of commerce;
and appeared as early as 1347,
in Cyprus, Sicily, Marseilles and some
of the seaports of Italy. The remaining
islands of the Mediterranean, particularly
Sardinia, Corsica and Majorca, were visited
in succession. Foci of contagion existed
also in full activity along the whole southern
coast of Europe; when, in January
1348, the plague appeared in Avignon<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span>
and in other cities in the south of France
and north of Italy, as well as in Spain.</p>

<p>The precise days of its eruption in the
individual towns, are no longer to be ascertained;
but it was not simultaneous: for
in Florence, the disease appeared in the
beginning of April<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> in Cesena, the 1st of
June<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> and place after place was attacked
throughout the whole year; so that the
plague, after it had passed through the<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
whole of France and Germany, where,
however, it did not make its ravages until
the following year, did not break out till
August, in England; where it advanced
so gradually, that a period of three months
elapsed before it reached London<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> The
Northern Kingdoms were attacked by it
in 1349. Sweden, indeed, not until November
of that year: almost two years
after its eruption in Avignon<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> Poland
received the plague in 1349, probably
from Germany<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> if not from the northern
countries; but in Russia, it did not make
its appearance until 1351, more than three
years after it had broken out in Constantinople.
Instead of advancing in a north-westerly
direction from Tauris and from
the Caspian Sea, it had thus made the great
circuit of the Black Sea, by way of Constan<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>tinople,
Southern and Central Europe, England,
the Northern Kingdoms and Poland,
before it reached the Russian territories;
a phenomenon which has not again occurred
with respect to more recent pestilences
originating in Asia.</p>

<p>Whether any difference existed between
the indigenous plague, excited by the influence
of the atmosphere, and that which
was imported by contagion, can no longer
be ascertained from the facts; for the contemporaries,
who in general were not competent
to make accurate researches of
this kind, have left no data on the subject.
A milder and a more malignant form
certainly existed, and the former was not
always derived from the latter, as is
to be supposed from this circumstance&mdash;that
the spitting of blood, the infallible
diagnostic of the latter, on the first breaking
out of the plague, is not similarly mentioned
in all the reports; and it is therefore
probable, that the milder form belonged
to the native plague,&mdash;the more malignant,<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
to that introduced by contagion. Contagion
was, however, in itself, only one
of many causes which gave rise to the
Black Plague.</p>

<p>This disease was a consequence of violent
commotions in the earth’s organism&mdash;if any
disease of cosmical origin can be so considered.
One spring set a thousand others
in motion for the annihilation of living
beings, transient or permanent, of mediate
or immediate effect. The most powerful
of all was contagion; for in the most
distant countries which had scarcely yet
heard the echo of the first concussion, the
people fell a sacrifice to organic poison,&mdash;the
untimely offspring of vital energies
thrown into violent commotion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mortality.</span></h3>


<p>We have no certain measure by which
to estimate the ravages of the Black Plague,
if numerical statements were wanted, as
in modern times. Let us go back for
a moment to the 14th century. The people
were yet but little civilized. The church
had indeed subdued them; but they all
suffered from the ill-consequences of their
original rudeness. The dominion of the
law was not yet confirmed. Sovereigns
had everywhere to combat powerful enemies
to internal tranquillity and security.
The cities were fortresses for their own
defence. Marauders encamped on the
roads&mdash;The husbandman was a feodal
slave, without possessions of his own.&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>Rudeness
was general&mdash;Humanity, as yet
unknown to the people.&mdash;Witches and
heretics were burned alive.&mdash;Gentle rulers
were contemned as weak;&mdash;wild passions,
severity and cruelty, everywhere predominated.&mdash;Human
life was little regarded.&mdash;Governments
concerned not themselves
about the numbers of their subjects, for
whose welfare it was incumbent on them
to provide. Thus, the first requisite for
estimating the loss of human life, namely,
a knowledge of the amount of the population,
is altogether wanting; and, moreover,
the traditional statements of the
amount of this loss, are so vague, that from
this source likewise, there is only room
for probable conjecture.</p>

<p>Kairo lost daily, when the plague was
raging with its greatest violence, from 10
to 15,000; being as many as, in modern
times, great plagues have carried off
during their whole course. In China,
more than thirteen millions are said to
have died; and this is in correspondence<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
with the certainly exaggerated accounts
from the rest of Asia. India was depopulated.
Tartary, the Tartar Kingdom of
Kaptschak, Mesapotamia, Syria, Armenia,
were covered with dead bodies&mdash;the Kurds
fled in vain to the mountains. In Caramania
and Caesarea, none were left alive.
On the roads,&mdash;in the camps,&mdash;in the
caravansaries,&mdash;unburied bodies alone
were seen; and a few cities only (Arabian
historians name, Maara el nooman, Schisur
and Harem) remained, in an unaccountable
manner, free. In Aleppo, 500 died
daily; 22,000 people, and most of the
animals, were carried off in Gaza, within
six weeks. Cyprus lost almost all its
inhabitants<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> and ships without crews
were often seen in the Mediterranean; as
afterwards in the North Sea, driving about,
and spreading the plague wherever they
went on shore<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> It was reported to Pope<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
Clement, at Avignon, that throughout the
East, probably with the exception of China,
23,840,000 people had fallen victims to the
plague<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> Considering the occurrences of
the 14th and 15th centuries, we might, on
first view, suspect the accuracy of this
statement. How (it might be asked) could
such great wars have been carried on&mdash;such
powerful efforts have been made; how could
the Greek empire, only a hundred years later,
have been overthrown, if the people really
had been so utterly destroyed?</p>

<p>This account is nevertheless rendered
credible by the ascertained fact, that the
palaces of princes are less accessible to
contagious diseases, than the dwellings of
the multitude; and that in places of importance,
the influx from those districts
which have suffered least, soon repairs even
the heaviest losses. We must remember
also, that we do not gather much from
mere numbers without an intimate know<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>ledge
of the state of Society. We will,
therefore, confine ourselves to exhibiting
some of the more credible accounts relative
to European cities.</p>

<p>This short catalogue might, by a laborious
and uncertain calculation, deduced<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
from other sources, be easily further multiplied,
but would still fail to give a true
picture of the depopulation which took
place. Lübeck, at that time the Venice
of the North, which could no longer contain
the multitudes that flocked to it, was
thrown into such consternation on the
eruption of the plague, that the citizens
destroyed themselves as if in frenzy.</p>

<p>Merchants whose earnings and possessions
were unbounded, coldly and willingly
renounced their earthly goods. They
carried their treasures to monasteries and
churches, and laid them at the foot of the
altar; but gold had no charms for the monks,
for it brought them death. They shut their
gates; yet, still it was cast to them over
the convent walls. People would brook
no impediment to the last pious work to
which they were driven by despair. When
the plague ceased, men thought they were
still wandering among the dead, so appalling
was the livid aspect of the survivors,
in consequence of the anxiety they had<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
undergone, and the unavoidable infection
of the air<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> Many other cities probably
presented a similar appearance; and it is
ascertained that a great number of small
country towns and villages which have been
estimated, and not too highly, at 200,000<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span>
were bereft of all their inhabitants.</p>

<p>In many places in France not more than
two out of twenty of the inhabitants were
left alive<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> and the capital felt the fury of
the plague, alike in the palace and the cot.</p>

<p>Two queens<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> one bishop<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> and great
numbers of other distinguished persons, fell
a sacrifice to it, and more than 500 a day
died in the Hôtel-Dieu, under the faithful
care of the sisters of charity, whose disinterested
courage, in this age of horror,<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
displayed the most beautiful traits of human
virtue. For although they lost their
lives, evidently from contagion, and their
numbers were several times renewed, there
was still no want of fresh candidates, who,
strangers to the unchristian fear of death,
piously devoted themselves to their holy
calling.</p>

<p>The church-yards were soon unable to
contain the dead<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> and many houses, left
without inhabitants, fell to ruins.</p>

<p>In Avignon, the pope found it necessary
to consecrate the Rhone, that bodies might
be thrown into the river without delay,
as the church-yards would no longer
hold them<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> so likewise, in all populous
cities, extraordinary measures were adopted,
in order speedily to dispose of the dead.
In Vienna, where for some time 1200 in<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>habitants
died daily<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> the interment of
corpses in the church-yards and within
the churches, was forthwith prohibited;
and the dead were then arranged in layers,
by thousands, in six large pits outside
the city<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> as had already been done in
Cairo and Paris. Yet, still many were
secretly buried; for at all times, the people
are attached to the consecrated cemeteries
of their dead, and will not renounce the
customary mode of interment.</p>

<p>In many places, it was rumoured that
plague patients were buried alive<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> as may<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
sometimes happen through senseless alarm
and indecent haste; and thus the horror of
the distressed people was every where increased.
In Erfurt, after the church-yards
were filled, 12,000 corpses were thrown
into eleven great pits; and the like might,
more or less exactly, be stated with respect
to all the larger cities<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> Funeral ceremonies,
the last consolation of the survivors,
were every where impracticable.</p>

<p>In all Germany, according to a probable
calculation, there seem to have died
only 1,244,<span class="nowrap">434<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> inhabitants; this country,
however, was more spared than others:
Italy, on the contrary, was most severely
visited. It is said to have lost half its
inhabitants<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> and this account is rendered
credible from the immense losses of individual
cities and provinces: for in Sardinia and<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
Corsica, according to the account of the
distinguished Florentine, John Villani,
who was himself carried off by the Black
Plague<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> scarcely a third part of the population
remained alive; and it is related
of the Venetians, that they engaged ships
at a high rate to retreat to the islands;
so that after the plague had carried off
three fourths of her inhabitants, that proud
city was left forlorn and desolate<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> In
Padua, after the cessation of the plague,
two thirds of the inhabitants were wanting;
and in Florence it was prohibited to
publish the numbers of the dead, and to
toll the bells at their funerals, in order
that the living might not abandon themselves
to despair<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span></p>

<p>We have more exact accounts of Eng<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>land;
most of the great cities suffered
incredible losses; above all, Yarmouth, in
which, 7052 died: Bristol, Oxford, Norwich,
Leicester, York and London where,
in one burial ground alone, there were
interred upwards of 50,000 corpses, arranged
in layers, in large pits<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> It is
said, that in the whole country, scarcely
a tenth part remained alive<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> but this
estimate is evidently too high. Smaller
losses were sufficient to cause those convulsions,
whose consequences were felt for
some centuries, in a false impulse given
to civil life, and whose indirect influence,
unknown to the English, has, perhaps,
extended even to modern times.</p>

<p>Morals were deteriorated every where,
and the service of God was, in a great measure,
laid aside; for, in many places, the
churches were deserted, being bereft of
their priests. The instruction of the people<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
was impeded<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> covetousness became general;
and when tranquility was restored,
the great increase of lawyers was astonishing,
to whom the endless disputes regarding
inheritances, offered a rich harvest.
The want of priests too, throughout the
country, operated very detrimentally upon
the people (the lower classes being most
exposed to the ravages of the plague,
whilst the houses of the nobility were,
in proportion, much more spared) and
it was no compensation that whole bands
of ignorant laymen, who had lost their
wives during the pestilence, crowded
into the monastic orders, that they might
participate in the respectability of the
priesthood, and in the rich heritages which<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
fell in to the church from all quarters.
The sittings of Parliament, of the King’s
Bench, and of most of the other courts,
were suspended as long as the malady
raged. The laws of peace availed not
during the dominion of death. Pope Clement
took advantage of this state of disorder,
to adjust the bloody quarrel between
Edward III. and Philip VI.; yet he only
succeeded during the period that the plague
commanded peace. Philip’s death (1350)
annulled all treaties; and it is related,
that Edward, with other troops indeed,
but with the same leaders and knights,
again took the field. Ireland was much
less heavily visited than England. The
disease seems to have scarcely reached
the mountainous districts of that kingdom;
and Scotland too would, perhaps, have remained
free, had not the Scots availed
themselves of the discomfiture of the
English, to make an irruption into their
territory, which terminated in the destruction
of their army, by the plague and<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
by the sword, and the extension of the
pestilence, through those who escaped, over
the whole country.</p>

<p>At the commencement, there was in
England a superabundance of all the necessaries
of life; but the plague, which
seemed then to be the sole disease, was
soon accompanied by a fatal murrain
among cattle. Wandering about without
herdsmen, they fell by thousands; and, as
has likewise been observed in Africa, the
birds and beasts of prey are said not to
have touched them. Of what nature this
murrain may have been, can no more
be determined, than whether it originated
from communication with plague patients,
or from other causes; but thus much is
certain, that it did not break out until after
the commencement of the Black Death.
In consequence of this murrain, and the
impossibility of removing the corn from
the fields, there was every where a great
rise in the price of food, which to many
was inexplicable, because the harvest<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
had been plentiful; by others it was
attributed to the wicked designs of the
labourers and dealers; but it had its foundation
in the actual deficiency, arising from
circumstances by which individual classes
at all times endeavour to profit. For a
whole year, until it terminated in August,
1349, the Black Plague prevailed in this
beautiful island, and every where poisoned
the springs of comfort and prosperity<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span></p>

<p>In other countries, it generally lasted
only half a year, but returned frequently
in individual places; on which account,
some, without sufficient proof, assigned
to it a period of seven years<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span></p>

<p>Spain was uninteruptedly ravaged by
the Black Plague till after the year 1350,
to which the frequent internal feuds and
the wars with the Moors not a little contributed.
Alphonso XI., whose passion
for war carried him too far, died of it at<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
the siege of Gibraltar, on the 26th of
March, 1350. He was the only king
in Europe who fell a sacrifice to it; but
even before this period, inumerable families
had been thrown into affliction<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> The
mortality seems otherwise to have been
smaller in Spain than in Italy, and about
as considerable as in France.</p>

<p>The whole period during which the Black
Plague raged with destructive violence
in Europe, was, with the exception of
Russia, from the year 1347 to 1350. The
plagues, which in the sequel often returned
until the year 1383<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> we do not
consider as belonging to “the Great Mortality.”
They were rather common<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
pestilences, without inflammation of the
lungs, such as in former times, and in the
following centuries, were excited by the
matter of contagion everywhere existing,
and which, on every favorable occasion,
gained ground anew, as is usually the case
with this frightful disease.</p>

<p>The concourse of large bodies of people
was especially dangerous; and thus, the
premature celebration of the Jubilee, to
which Clement VI. cited the faithful to
Rome, (1350), during the great epidemic,
caused a new eruption of the plague,
from which it is said, that scarcely one in
an hundred of the pilgrims escaped<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span></p>

<p>Italy was, in consequence, depopulated
anew; and those who returned, spread
poison and corruption of morals in all
directions<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> It is, therefore, the less
apparent, how that Pope, who was in<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
general so wise and considerate, and who
knew how to pursue the path of reason
and humanity, under the most difficult
circumstances, should have been led to
adopt a measure so injurious; since he,
himself, was so convinced of the salutary
effect of seclusion, that during the plague
in Avignon, he kept up constant fires,
and suffered no one to approach him<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span>
and, in other respects, gave such orders as
averted, or alleviated, much misery.</p>

<p>The changes which occurred about this
period in the north of Europe, are sufficiently
memorable to claim a few moments
attention. In Sweden, two princes died&mdash;Häken
and Knut, half-brothers of King
Magnus; and in Westgothland alone, 466
priests<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> The inhabitants of Iceland and
Greenland, found in the coldness of their
inhospitable climate, no protection against
the southern enemy who had penetrated to<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
them from happier countries. The plague
caused great havoc among them. Nature
made no allowance for their constant
warfare with the elements, and the parsimony
with which she had meted out
to them the enjoyments of life<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> In
Denmark and Norway, however, people
were so occupied with their own misery,
that the accustomed voyages to Greenland
ceased. Towering ice-bergs formed
at the same time on the coast of East
Greenland, in consequence of the general
concussion of the earth’s organism; and no
mortal, from that time forward, has ever
seen that shore or its inhabitants<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span></p>

<p>It has been observed above, that in<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
Russia, the Black Plague did not break
out until 1351, after it had already passed
through the south and north of Europe.
In this country also, the mortality was
extraordinarily great; and the same scenes
of affliction and despair were exhibited,
as had occurred in those nations which
had already passed the ordeal. The same
mode of burial&mdash;the same horrible certainty
of death&mdash;the same torpor and depression
of spirits. The wealthy abandoned their
treasures, and gave their villages and
estates to the churches and monasteries;
this being, according to the notions of
the age, the surest way of securing the
favor of Heaven and the forgiveness of
past sins. In Russia too, the voice of
nature was silenced by fear and horror.
In the hour of danger, fathers and mothers
deserted their children, and children their
parents<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the estimates of the number of<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
lives lost in Europe, the most probable
is, that altogether, a fourth part of the
inhabitants were carried off. Now, if
Europe at present contain 210,000,000
inhabitants, the population, not to take a
higher estimate, which might easily be
justified, amounted to at least 105,000,000,
in the 16th century.</p>

<p>It may, therefore, be assumed, without
exaggeration, that Europe lost during the
Black Death, 25,000,000 of inhabitants.</p>

<p>That her nations could so quickly overcome
such a fearful concussion in their
external circumstances, and, in general,
without retrogading more than they actually
did, could so develope their energies in the
following century, is a most convincing
proof of the indestructibility of human
society as a whole. To assume, however,
that it did not suffer any essential change
internally, because in appearance every
thing remained as before, is inconsistent
with a just view of cause and effect. Many
historians seem to have adopted such an<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
opinion; accustomed, as usual, to judge
of the moral condition of the people solely
according to the vicissitudes of earthly
power, the events of battles, and the influence
of religion, but to pass over with
indifference, the great phenomena of nature,
which modify, not only the surface of the
earth, but also the human mind. Hence,
most of them have touched but superficially
on the “great mortality” of the
14th century. We, for our parts are
convinced, that in the history of the world,
the Black Death is one of the most important
events which have prepared the
way for the present state of Europe.</p>

<p>He who studies the human mind with
attention, and forms a deliberate judgment
on the intellectual powers which set people
and states in motion, may, perhaps, find
some proofs of this assertion in the following
observations:&mdash;at that time, the advancement
of the hierarchy was, in most
countries, extraordinary; for the church
acquired treasures and large properties in<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
land, even to a greater extent than after the
crusades; but experience has demonstrated,
that such a state of things is ruinous
to the people, and causes them to retrograde,
as was evinced on this occasion.</p>

<p>After the cessation of the Black Plague,
a greater fertility in women was everywhere
remarkable&mdash;a grand phenomenon,
which, from its occurrence after every destructive
pestilence, proves to conviction,
if any occurrence can do so, the prevalence
of a higher power in the direction of general
organic life. Marriages were, almost without
exception, prolific; and double and
treble births were more frequent than at
other times; under which head, we should
remember the strange remark, that after
the “great mortality” the children were
said to have got fewer teeth than before;
at which, contemporaries were mightily
shocked, and even later writers have felt
surprise.</p>

<p>If we examine the grounds of this oft-repeated
assertion, we shall find that they<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
were astonished, to see children cut twenty,
or at most, twenty-two teeth, under the
supposition that a greater number had
formerly fallen to their share<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> Some
writers of authority, as, for example, the
physician Savonarola<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> at Ferrara, who
probably looked for twenty-eight teeth in
children, published their opinions on this
subject. Others copied from them, without
seeing for themselves, as often happens in
other matters which are equally evident;
and thus the world believed in the miracle
of an imperfection in the human body
which had been caused by the Black
Plague.</p>

<p>The people gradually consoled themselves
after the sufferings which they had
undergone; the dead were lamented and
forgotten; and in the stirring vicissitudes<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
of existence, the world belonged to the
living<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Moral Effects.</span></h3>


<p>The mental shock sustained by all nations
during the prevalence of the Black Plague,
is without parallel and beyond description.
In the eyes of the timorous, danger was
the certain harbinger of death; many
fell victims to fear, on the first appearance
of the distemper<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> and the most
stout hearted lost their confidence. Thus,
after reliance on the future had died
away, the spiritual union which binds
man to his family and his fellow creatures,
was gradually dissolved. The pious closed
their accounts with the world,&mdash;eternity
presented itself to their view,&mdash;their only<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
remaining desire, was for a participation
in the consolations of religion, because
to them death was disarmed of its sting.</p>

<p>Repentance seized the transgressor, admonishing
him to consecrate his remaining
hours to the exercise of Christian virtues.
All minds were directed to the contemplation
of futurity; and children, who manifest
the more elevated feelings of the soul
without alloy, were frequently seen, while
labouring under the plague, breathing out
their spirit with prayer and songs of
thanksgiving<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>
<p>An awful sense of contrition seized
Christians of every communion; they resolved
to forsake their vices&mdash;to make
restitution for past offences, before they
were summoned hence&mdash;to seek reconciliation
with their Maker, and to avert,
by self-chastisement, the punishment due
to their former sins. Human nature would
be exalted, could the countless noble
actions, which, in times of most imminent
danger, were performed in secret,
be recorded for the instruction of future
generations. They, however, have no
influence on the course of worldly events.
They are known only to silent eye-witnesses,
and soon fall into oblivion. But hypocrisy,
illusion and bigotry, stalk abroad
undaunted; they desecrate what is noble&mdash;they
pervert what is divine, to the unholy
purposes of selfishness; which hurries
along every good feeling in the false<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
excitement of the age. Thus it was in
the years of this plague. In the 14th
century, the monastic system was still in
its full vigour,&mdash;the power of the ecclesiastical
orders and brotherhoods, was revered
by the people, and the hierarchy was
still formidable to the temporal power.
It was, therefore, in the natural constitution
of society that bigotted zeal, which
in such times makes a shew of public
acts of penance, should avail itself of the
semblance of religion. But this took
place in such a manner, that unbridled,
self-willed penitence, degenerated into
luke-warmness, renounced obedience to
the hierarchy, and prepared a fearful
opposition to the church, paralysed by
antiquated forms.</p>

<p>While all countries were filled with
lamentations and woe, there first arose
in Hungary<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> and afterwards in Germany,<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
the Brotherhood of the Flagellants, called
also the Brethren of the Cross, or Cross-bearers,
who took upon themselves the repentance
of the people, for the sins they
had committed, and offered prayers and
supplications for the averting of this plague.
This Order consisted chiefly of persons of
the lower class, who were either actuated
by sincere contrition, or, who joyfully
availed themselves of this pretext for idleness,
and were hurried along with the
tide of distracting frenzy. But, as these
brotherhoods gained in repute, and were
welcomed by the people with veneration
and enthusiasm, many nobles and ecclesiastics
ranged themselves under their
standard; and their bands were not unfrequently
augmented by children, honour<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>able
women and nuns; so powerfully
were minds of the most opposite temperaments
enslaved by this infatuation<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> They
marched through the cities, in well-organized
processions, with leaders and singers;
their heads covered as far as the eyes;
their look fixed on the ground, accompanied
by every token of the deepest contrition
and mourning. They were robed
in sombre garments, with red crosses on
the breast, back, and cap, and bore triple
scourges, tied in three or four knots, in
which points of iron were fixed. Tapers
and magnificent banners of velvet and
cloth of gold, were carried before them;<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
wherever they made their appearance, they
were welcomed by the ringing of the bells;
and the people flocked from all quarters,
to listen to their hymns and to witness
their penance, with devotion and tears. In
the year 1349, two hundred Flagellants first
entered Strasburg, where they were received
with great joy, and hospitably lodged by
the citizens. Above a thousand joined the
brotherhood, which now assumed the appearance
of a wandering tribe, and separated
into two bodies, for the purpose of journeying
to the north and to the south. For
more than half a year, new parties arrived
weekly; and, on each arrival, adults and
children left their families to accompany
them; till, at length, their sanctity was
questioned, and the doors of houses and
churches were closed against them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> At
Spires, two hundred boys, of twelve years
of age and under, constituted themselves<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
into a Brotherhood of the Cross, in imitation
of the children, who, about a hundred
years before, had united, at the instigation
of some fanatic monks, for the purpose of
recovering the Holy Sepulchre. All the
inhabitants of this town, were carried
away by the illusion; they conducted the
strangers to their houses with songs of
thanksgiving, to regale them for the night.
The women embroidered banners for them,
and all were anxious to augment their
pomp; and at every succeeding pilgrimage,
their influence and reputation increased<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span>
It was not merely some individual
parts of the country that fostered
them: all Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia,
Silesia, and Flanders, did homage to
the mania; and they at length became as
formidable to the secular, as they were to
the ecclesiastical power. The influence of
this fanaticism, was great and threatening;<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
resembling the excitement which called all
the inhabitants of Europe into the deserts
of Syria and Palestine, about two hundred
and fifty years before. The appearance, in
itself, was not novel. As far back as the
11th century, many believers, in Asia and
Southern Europe, afflicted themselves with
the punishment of flagellation. Dominicus
Loricatus, a monk of St. Croce d’Avellano,
is mentioned as the master and model of
this species of mortification of the flesh;
which, according to the primitive notions
of the Asiatic Anchorites, was deemed
eminently Christian. The author of the
solemn processions of the Flagellants, is
said to have been St. Anthony; for even in
his time (1231), this kind of penance was
so much in vogue, that it is recorded as an
eventful circumstance in the history of the
world. In 1260, the Flagellants appeared
in Italy as <i>Devoti</i>. “When the land was
polluted by vices and crimes<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> an un<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>exampled
spirit of remorse suddenly seized
the minds of the Italians. The fear of
Christ fell upon all: noble and ignoble, old
and young, and even children of five years
of age, marched through the streets with no
covering but a scarf round the waist. They
each carried a scourge of leathern thongs,
which they applied to their limbs, amid
sighs and tears, with such violence, that the
blood flowed from the wounds. Not only
during the day, but even by night, and in
the severest winter, they traversed the
cities with burning torches and banners, in
thousands and tens of thousands, headed by
their priests, and prostrated themselves before
the altars. They proceeded in the same
manner in the villages; and the woods and
mountains resounded with the voices of
those whose cries were raised to God.
The melancholy chaunt of the penitent
alone, was heard. Enemies were reconciled;
men and women vied with each
other in splendid works of charity, as if
they dreaded, that Divine Omnipotence<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
would pronounce on them the doom of
annihilation.”</p>

<p>The pilgrimages of the Flagellants extended
throughout all the provinces of
Southern Germany, as far as Saxony, Bohemia
and Poland, and even further; but at
length, the priests resisted this dangerous
fanaticism, without being able to extirpate
the illusion, which was advantageous to
the hierarchy, as long as it submitted to
its sway. Regnier, a hermit of Perugia,
is recorded as a fanatic preacher of penitence,
with whom the extravagance originated<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span>
In the year 1296, there was
a great procession of the Flagellants in
Strasburg<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span> and in 1334, fourteen years
before the great mortality, the sermon of
Venturinus, a Dominican friar, of Bergamo,
induced above 10,000 persons to undertake
a new pilgrimage. They scourged
themselves in the churches, and were
entertained in the market-places, at the<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
public expense. At Rome, Venturinus
was derided, and banished by the Pope to
the mountains of Ricondona. He patiently
endured all&mdash;went to the Holy Land, and
died at Smyrna, 1346<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> Hence we see
that this fanaticism was a mania of the
middle ages, which, in the year 1349, on
so fearful an occasion, and while still so
fresh in remembrance, needed no new
founder; of whom, indeed, all the records
are silent. It probably arose in many
places at the same time; for the terror of
death, which pervaded all nations and sud<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>denly
set such powerful impulses in motion,
might easily conjure up the fanaticism of
exaggerated and overpowering repentance.</p>

<p>The manner and proceedings of the Flagellants
of the 13th and 14th centuries,
exactly resemble each other. But, if
during the Black Plague, simple credulity
came to their aid, which seized, as a consolation,
the grossest delusion of religious
enthusiasm, yet it is evident that the
leaders must have been intimately united,
and have exercised the power of a secret
association. Besides, the rude band was
generally under the controul of men of
learning, some of whom at least, certainly
had other objects in view, independent of
those which ostensibly appeared. Whoever
was desirous of joining the brotherhood, was
bound to remain in it thirty-four days, and
to have four-pence per day at his own disposal,
so that he might not be burthensome
to any one; if married, he was
obliged to have the sanction of his wife,
and give the assurance that he was recon<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>ciled
to all men. The Brothers of the
Cross, were not permitted to seek for free
quarters, or even to enter a house without
having been invited; they were forbidden
to converse with females; and if they
transgressed these rules, or acted without
precaution, they were obliged to confess
to the Superior, who sentenced them to
several lashes of the scourge, by way of
penance. Ecclesiastics had not, as such,
any pre-eminence among them; according
to their original law, which, however, was
often transgressed, they could not become
Masters, or take part in the <i>Secret Councils</i>.
Penance was performed twice every day: in
the morning and evening, they went abroad
in pairs, singing psalms, amid the ringing
of the bells; and when they arrived at the
place of flagellation, they stripped the upper
part of their bodies and put off their shoes,
keeping on only a linen dress, reaching from
the waist to the ancles. They then lay
down in a large circle, in different positions,
according to the nature of their crime:<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
the adulterer with his face to the ground;
the perjurer on one side, holding up three
of his fingers, &amp;c., and were then castigated,
some more and some less, by the
Master, who ordered them to rise in the
words of a prescribed form<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> Upon this,
they scourged themselves, amid the singing
of psalms and loud supplications for the
averting of the plague, with genuflexions,
and other ceremonies, of which contemporary
writers give various accounts; and
at the same time constantly boasted of their
penance, that the blood of their wounds
was mingled with that of the Saviour<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span>
One of them, in conclusion, stood up to read
a letter, which it was pretended an angel
had brought from heaven, to St. Peter’s
church, at Jerusalem, stating that Christ,
who was sore displeased at the sins of
man, had granted at the intercession of the<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
Holy Virgin and of the angels, that all
who should wander about for thirty-four
days and scourge themselves, should be
partakers of the Divine grace<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> This scene
caused as great a commotion among the
believers as the finding of the holy spear
once did at Antioch; and if any among
the clergy enquired who had sealed the
letter? he was boldly answered, the same
who had sealed the Gospel!</p>

<p>All this had so powerful an effect, that
the church was in considerable danger;
for the Flagellants gained more credit than
the priests, from whom they so entirely
withdrew themselves, that they even absolved
each other. Besides, they everywhere
took possession of the churches,
and their new songs, which went from
mouth to mouth, operated strongly on the
minds of the people. Great enthusiasm
and originally pious feelings, are clearly
distinguishable in these hymns, and espe<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>cially
in the chief psalm of the Cross-bearers,
which is still extant, and which
was sung all over Germany, in different
dialects, and is probably of a more ancient
date<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> Degeneracy, however, soon crept
in; crimes were everywhere committed;
and there was no energetic man capable<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
of directing the individual excitement to
purer objects, even had an effectual resistance
to the tottering church been at that
early period seasonable, and had it been
possible to restrain the fanaticism. The
Flagellants sometimes undertook to make
trial of their power of working miracles; as
in Strasburg, where they attempted, in
their own circle, to resuscitate a dead
child: they however failed, and their unskilfulness
did them much harm, though
they succeeded here and there in maintaining
some confidence in their holy calling,
by pretending to have the power of casting
out evil spirits<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span></p>

<p>The Brotherhood of the Cross announced
that the pilgrimage of the Flagellants was
to continue for a space of thirty-four
years; and many of the Masters had,
doubtless, determined to form a lasting
league against the church; but they had
gone too far. Already, in the same year,<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
the general indignation set bounds to
their intrigues; so that the strict measures
adopted by the Emperor Charles IV. and
Pope Clement<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> who, throughout the whole
of this fearful period, manifested prudence
and noble-mindedness, and conducted himself
in a manner every way worthy of his
high station, were easily put into execution<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span></p>

<p>The Sorbonne, at Paris, and the Emperor
Charles, had already applied to the
Holy See, for assistance against these formidable
and heretical excesses, which had
well nigh destroyed the influence of the
clergy in every place; when a hundred of
the Brotherhood of the Cross arrived at
Avignon from Basle, and desired admission.<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
The Pope, regardless of the intercession of
several cardinals, interdicted their public
penance, which he had not authorized;
and, on pain of excommunication, prohibited
throughout Christendom the continuance
of these pilgrimages<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> Philip VI.,
supported by the condemnatory judgment
of the Sorbonne, forbid their reception in
France<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span> Manfred, King of Sicily, at the
same time threatened them with punishment
by death: and in the East, they
were withstood by several bishops, among
whom was Janussius, of Gnesen<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> and
Preczlaw, of Breslaw, who condemned
to death one of their Masters, formerly a
deacon; and, in conformity with the barbarity
of the times, had him publicly
burnt<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> In Westphalia, where so shortly<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
before, they had venerated the Brothers
of the Cross, they now persecuted them
with relentless severity<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> and in the Mark,
as well as in all the other countries
of Germany, they pursued them, as if
they had been the authors of every misfortune<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span></p>

<p>The processions of the Brotherhood of the
Cross, undoubtedly promoted the spreading
of the plague; and it is evident, that
the gloomy fanaticism which gave rise to
them, would infuse a new poison into the
already desponding minds of the people.</p>

<p>Still, however, all this was within the
bounds of barbarous enthusiasm; but horrible
were the persecutions of the Jews,
which were committed in most countries,
with even greater exasperation than in the
12th century, during the first Crusades.
In every destructive pestilence, the common
people at first attribute the mortality to<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
poison. No instruction avails; the supposed
testimony of their eyesight, is to
them a proof, and they authoritatively
demand the victims of their rage. On
whom then was it so likely to fall, as on
the Jews, the usurers and the strangers
who lived at enmity with the Christians?
They were everywhere suspected of having
poisoned the wells or infected the air<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span>
They alone were considered as having
brought this fearful mortality among the
Christians<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> They were, in consequence,
pursued with merciless cruelty; and either
indiscriminately given up to the fury of
the populace, or sentenced by sanguinary<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
tribunals, which, with all the forms of law,
ordered them to be burnt alive. In times
like these, much is indeed said of guilt
and innocence; but hatred and revenge
bear down all discrimination, and the
smallest probability, magnifies suspicion
into certainty. These bloody scenes, which
disgraced Europe in the 14th century, are
a counterpart to a similar mania of the
age, which was manifested in the persecutions
of witches and sorcerers; and,
like these, they prove, that enthusiasm,
associated with hatred, and leagued with
the baser passions, may work more powerfully
upon whole nations, than religion and
legal order; nay, that it even knows how
to profit by the authority of both, in order
the more surely to satiate with blood, the
sword of long suppressed revenge.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Jews, commenced
in September and October, 1348<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>
at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, where<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
the first criminal proceedings were instituted
against them, after they had long before
been accused by the people of poisoning
the wells; similar scenes followed in Bern
and Freyburg, in January, 1349. Under
the influence of excruciating suffering, the
tortured Jews confessed themselves guilty
of the crime imputed to them; and it
being affirmed that poison had in fact
been found in a well at Zoffingen, this
was deemed a sufficient proof to convince
the world; and the persecution of the
abhorred culprits, thus appeared justifiable.
Now, though we can take as little exception
at these proceedings, as at the
multifarious confessions of witches, because
the interrogatories of the fanatic and sanguinary
tribunals, were so complicated,
that by means of the rack, the required
answer must inevitably be obtained; and
it is besides conformable to human nature,
that crimes which are in every body’s
mouth, may, in the end, be actually committed
by some, either from wantonness,<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
revenge, or desperate exasperation: yet
crimes and accusations, are, under circumstances
like these, merely the offspring
of a revengeful, frenzied, spirit in the
people; and the accusers, according to
the fundamental principles of morality,
which are the same in every age, are the
more guilty transgressors.</p>

<p>Already in the autumn of 1348, a dreadful
panic, caused by the supposed poisoning,
seized all nations; and in Germany
especially, the springs and wells were
built over, that nobody might drink of
them, or employ the water for culinary purposes;
and for a long time, the inhabitants
of numerous towns and villages, used only
river and rain water<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> The city gates
were also guarded with the greatest<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
caution,&mdash;only confidential persons were
admitted; and if medicine, or any other
article, which might be supposed to be
poisonous, was found in the possession
of a stranger,&mdash;and it was natural that
some should have these things by them
for their private use,&mdash;they were forced
to swallow a portion of it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> By this trying
state of privation, distrust and suspicion,
the hatred against the supposed poisoners,
became greatly increased, and often broke
out in popular commotions, which only
served still further to infuriate the wildest
passions. The noble and the mean, fearlessly
bound themselves by an oath, to
extirpate the Jews by fire and sword,
and to snatch them from their protectors,
of whom the number was so small, that
throughout all Germany, but few places
can be mentioned where these unfortunate
people were not regarded as outlaws&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>martyred
and burnt<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> Solemn summonses
were issued from Bern to the towns
of Basle, Freyburg in the Breisgau, and
Strasburg, to pursue the Jews as poisoners.
The Burgomasters and Senators, indeed,
opposed this requisition; but in Basle the
populace obliged them to bind themselves
by an oath, to burn the Jews, and to forbid
persons of that community from entering
their city, for the space of two hundred
years. Upon this, all the Jews in Basle,
whose number could not have been inconsiderable,
were enclosed in a wooden
building, constructed for the purpose, and
burnt together with it, upon the mere
outcry of the people, without sentence
or trial, which indeed would have availed
them nothing. Soon after, the same thing
took place at Freyburg. A regular Diet
was held at Bennefeld, in Alsace, where
the bishops, lords and barons, as also
deputies of the counts (<i>query</i> counties?)
and towns, consulted how they should proceed
with regard to the Jews; and when<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
the deputies of Strasburg&mdash;not indeed the
bishop of this town, who proved himself
a violent fanatic&mdash;spoke in favor of the
persecuted, as nothing criminal was substantiated
against them; a great outcry
was raised, and it was vehemently asked,
why, if so, they had covered their wells
and removed their buckets? A sanguinary
decree was resolved upon, of which the
populace, who obeyed the call of the nobles
and superior clergy, became but the too
willing executioners<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> Wherever the Jews
were not burnt, they were at least banished;
and so being compelled to wander about,
they fell into the hands of the country
people, who without humanity, and regardless
of all laws, persecuted them with fire
and sword. At Spires, the Jews, driven to
despair, assembled in their own habitations,
which they set on fire, and thus consumed
themselves with their families. The few<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
that remained, were forced to submit to
baptism; while the dead bodies of the
murdered, which lay about the streets,
were put into empty wine casks, and
rolled into the Rhine, lest they should
infect the air. The mob was forbidden
to enter the ruins of the habitations that
were burnt in the Jewish quarter; for
the senate itself caused search to be
made for the treasure, which is said to
have been very considerable. At Strasburg,
two thousand Jews were burnt alive
in their own burial ground, where a large
scaffold had been erected: a few who promised
to embrace Christianity, were spared,
and their children taken from the pile.
The youth and beauty of several females
also excited some commiseration; and they
were snatched from death against their
will: many, however, who forcibly made
their escape from the flames, were murdered
in the streets.</p>

<p>The senate ordered all pledges and bonds<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
to be returned to the debtors, and divided
the money among the work-people<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span>
Many, however, refused to accept the base
price of blood, and, indignant at the scenes
of blood-thirsty avarice, which made the
infuriated multitude <span class="nowrap">forget<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> that the plague
was raging around them, presented it to
monastaries, in conformity with the advice
of their confessors. In all the countries
on the Rhine, these cruelties continued
to be perpetrated during the succeeding
months; and after quiet was in some
degree restored, the people thought to
render an acceptable service to God, by<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
taking the bricks of the destroyed dwellings,
and the tombstones of the Jews,
to repair churches and to erect belfreys<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span></p>

<p>In Mayence alone, 12,000 Jews are
said to have been put to a cruel death.
The Flagellants entered that place in
August; the Jews, on this occasion, fell
out with the Christians, and killed several;
but when they saw their inability to withstand
the increasing superiority of their
enemies, and that nothing could save
them from destruction, they consumed
themselves and their families, by setting
fire to their dwellings. Thus also, in other
places, the entry of the Flagellants gave
rise to scenes of slaughter; and as thirst for
blood was everywhere combined with an
unbridled spirit of proselytism, a fanatic
zeal arose among the Jews, to perish as
martyrs to their ancient religion. And
how was it possible, that they could from
the heart embrace Christianity, when its<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
precepts were never more outrageously
violated? At Eslingen, the whole Jewish
community burned themselves in their
synagogue<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> and mothers were often seen
throwing their children on the pile, to
prevent their being baptised, and then
precipitating themselves into the flames<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>
In short, whatever deeds, fanaticism, revenge,
avarice and desperation, in fearful
combination, could instigate mankind to
perform,&mdash;and where in such a case is
the limit?&mdash;were executed in the year
1349, throughout Germany, Italy and
France, with impunity, and in the eyes
of all the world. It seemed as if the
plague gave rise to scandalous acts and
frantic tumults, not to mourning and grief:
and the greater part of those who, by
their education and rank, were called
upon to raise the voice of reason, themselves
led on the savage mob to murder<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
and to plunder. Almost all the Jews who
saved their lives by baptism, were afterwards
burnt at different times; for they
continued to be accused of poisoning the
water and the air. Christians also, whom
philanthropy or gain had induced to offer
them protection, were put on the rack
and executed with them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> Many Jews
who had embraced Christianity, repented
of their apostacy,&mdash;and, returning to their
former faith, sealed it with their death<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span></p>

<p>The humanity and prudence of Clement
VI., must, on this occasion, also
be mentioned to his honor; but even the
highest ecclesiastical power was insufficient
to restrain the unbridled fury of the people.
He not only protected the Jews at Avignon,
as far as lay in his power, but also issued
two bulls, in which he declared them innocent;
and admonished all Christians,
though without success, to cease from such<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
groundless persecutions<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> The Emperor
Charles IV. was also favourable to them,
and sought to avert their destruction,
wherever he could; but he dared not draw
the sword of justice, and even found himself
obliged to yield to the selfishness of
the Bohemian nobles, who were unwilling
to forego so favorable an opportunity of
releasing themselves from their Jewish
creditors, under favor of an imperial mandate<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span>
Duke Albert of Austria burned
and pillaged those of his cities, which
had persecuted the Jews,&mdash;a vain and
inhuman proceeding, which, moreover,
is not exempt from the suspicion of
covetousness; yet he was unable, in his
own fortress of Kyberg, to protect some
hundreds of Jews, who had been received
there, from being barbarously burnt by the
inhabitants<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> Several other princes and<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
counts, among whom was Ruprecht von
der Pfalz, took the Jews under their
protection, on the payment of large sums:
in consequence of which they were called
“Jew-masters,” and were in danger of
being attacked by the populace and by
their powerful neighbours<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> These persecuted
and ill-used people, except indeed
where humane individuals took compassion
on them at their own peril, or when they<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
could command riches to purchase protection,
had no place of refuge left but the
distant country of Lithuania, where Boleslav
V., Duke of Poland (1227–1279), had
before granted them liberty of conscience;
and King Casimir the Great (1333–1370),
yielding to the entreaties of Esther, a
favourite Jewess, received them, and
granted them further protection<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> on which
account, that country is still inhabited by
a great number of Jews, who by their
secluded habits, have, more than any
people in Europe, retained the manners
of the middle ages.</p>

<p>But to return to the fearful accusations
against the Jews: it was reported in all
Europe, that they were in connection with<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
secret superiors in Toledo, to whose decrees
they were subject, and from whom they had
received commands respecting the coining
of base money, poisoning, the murder of
Christian children, &amp;c.<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> that they received
the poison by sea from remote parts, and
also prepared it themselves from spiders,
owls and other venomous animals; but, in
order that their secret might not be discovered,
that it was known only to their
Rabbis and rich men<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> Apparently there
were but few who did not consider this extravagant
accusation well founded; indeed,
in many writings of the 14th century, we
find great acrimony with regard to the suspected
poison-mixers, which plainly demonstrates
the prejudice existing against
them. Unhappily, after the confessions of
the first victims in Switzerland, the rack
extorted similar ones in various places.
Some even acknowledged having received<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
poisonous powder in bags, and injunctions
from Toledo, by secret messengers. Bags
of this description, were also often found in
wells, though it was not unfrequently discovered
that the Christians themselves
had thrown them in; probably to give
occasion to murder and pillage; similar
instances of which may be found in the
persecutions of the witches<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span></p>

<p>This picture needs no additions. A
lively image of the Black Plague, and of
the moral evil which followed in its train,
will vividly represent itself to him who
is acquainted with nature and the constitution
of society. Almost the only
credible accounts of the manner of living,
and of the ruin which occurred in private
life, during this pestilence, are from Italy;
and these may enable us to form a just
estimate of the general state of families
in Europe, taking into consideration what
is peculiar in the manners of each country.</p>

<p>“When the evil had become universal,”
(speaking of Florence) “the hearts of all
the inhabitants were closed to feelings of
humanity. They fled from the sick and
all that belonged to them, hoping by these
means to save themselves. Others shut
themselves up in their houses, with their
wives, their children and households, living<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
on the most costly food, but carefully avoiding
all excess. None were allowed access
to them; no intelligence of death or sickness
was permitted to reach their ear;
and they spent their time in singing and
music, and other pastimes. Others, on
the contrary, considered eating and drinking
to excess, amusements of all descriptions,
the indulgence of every gratification,
and an indifference to what was passing
around them, as the best medicine, and
acted accordingly. They wandered day
and night, from one tavern to another, and
feasted without moderation or bounds.
In this way they endeavoured to avoid
all contact with the sick, and abandoned
their houses and property to chance, like
men whose death-knell had already tolled.</p>

<p>Amid this general lamentation and woe,
the influence and authority of every law,
human and divine, vanished. Most of
those who were in office, had been carried
off by the plague, or lay sick, or had lost
so many members of their families, that<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
they were unable to attend to their duties;
so that thenceforth every one acted as he
thought proper. Others, in their mode of
living, chose a middle course. They ate
and drank what they pleased, and walked
abroad, carrying odoriferous flowers, herbs
or spices, which they smelt to from time to
time, in order to invigorate the brain, and
to avert the baneful influence of the air,
infected by the sick, and by the innumerable
corpses of those who had died
of the plague. Others carried their precaution
still further, and thought the
surest way to escape death was by flight.
They therefore left the city; women as well
men abandoning their dwellings and their
relations, and retiring into the country.
But of these also, many were carried off,
most of them alone and deserted by all
the world, themselves having previously
set the example. Thus it was, that one
citizen fled from another&mdash;a neighbour from
his neighbours&mdash;a relation from his relations;&mdash;and
in the end, so completely had<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
terror extinguished every kindlier feeling,
that the brother forsook the brother&mdash;the
sister the sister&mdash;the wife her husband;
and at last, even the parent his own
offspring, and abandoned them, unvisited
and unsoothed, to their fate. Those, therefore,
that stood in need of assistance fell
a prey to greedy attendants; who for an
exorbitant recompence, merely handed the
sick their food and medicine, remained
with them in their last moments, and
then, not unfrequently, became themselves
victims to their avarice and lived not to
enjoy their extorted gain. Propriety and
decorum were extinguished among the
helpless sick. Females of rank seemed to
forget their natural bashfulness, and committed
the care of their persons, indiscriminately,
to men and women of the
lowest order. No longer were women,
relatives or friends, found in the house of
mourning, to share the grief of the survivors&mdash;no
longer was the corpse accompanied
to the grave by neighbours and a<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
numerous train of priests, carrying wax
tapers and singing psalms, nor was it borne
along by other citizens of equal rank.
Many breathed their last without a friend
to sooth their dying pillow; and few
indeed were they who departed amid
the lamentations and tears of their friends
and kindred. Instead of sorrow and
mourning, appeared indifference, frivolity
and mirth; this being considered, especially
by the females, as conducive to
health. Seldom was the body followed by
even ten or twelve attendants; and instead
of the usual bearers and sextons, mercenaries
of the lowest of the populace undertook
the office for the sake of gain;
and accompanied by only a few priests,
and often without a single taper, it was
borne to the very nearest church, and
lowered into the first grave that was not
already too full to receive it. Among
the middling classes, and especially among
the poor, the misery was still greater.
Poverty or negligence induced most of<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
these to remain in their dwellings, or in
the immediate neighbourhood; and thus
they fell by thousands; and many ended
their lives in the streets, by day and
by night. The stench of putrefying
corpses was often the first indication to
their neighbours that more deaths had occurred.
The survivors, to preserve themselves
from infection, generally had the
bodies taken out of the houses, and laid
before the doors; where the early morn
found them in heaps, exposed to the
affrighted gaze of the passing stranger.
It was no longer possible to have a bier
for every corpse,&mdash;three or four were
generally laid together&mdash;husband and
wife, father and mother, with two or three
children, were frequently borne to the
grave on the same bier; and it often
happened that two priests would accompany
a coffin, bearing the cross before
it, and be joined on the way by several
other funerals; so that instead of one,
there were five or six bodies for interment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span></p>

<p>Thus far Boccacio. On the conduct
of the priests, another contemporary observes<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span>
“In large and small towns, they
had withdrawn themselves through fear,
leaving the performance of ecclesiastical
duties to the few who were found courageous
and faithful enough to undertake them.”
But we ought not on that account to
throw more blame on them than on others;
for we find proofs of the same timidity
and heartlessness in every class. During
the prevalence of the Black Plague, the
charitable orders conducted themselves
admirably, and did as much good as can
be done by individual bodies, in times of
great misery and destruction; when compassion,
courage, and the nobler feelings,
are found but in the few,&mdash;while cowardice,
selfishness and ill-will, with the baser
passions in their train&mdash;assert the supremacy.
In place of virtue which had been
driven from the earth, wickedness every<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>where
reared her rebellious standard, and
succeeding generations were consigned to
the dominion of her baleful tyranny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Physicians.</span></h3>


<p>If we now turn to the medical talent
which encountered the “Great Mortality,”
the middle ages must stand excused,
since even the moderns are of opinion
that the art of medicine is not able to cope
with the Oriental plague, and can afford
deliverance from it only under particularly
favorable circumstances<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> We must
bear in mind also, that human science
and art, appear particularly weak in great
pestilences, because they have to contend
with the powers of nature, of which they
have no knowledge; and which, if they
had been, or could be comprehended in<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
their collective effects, would remain uncontrollable
by them, principally on account
of the disordered condition of human
society. Moreover, every new plague has
its peculiarities, which are the less easily
discovered on first view, because, during
its ravages, fear and consternation humble
the proud spirit.</p>

<p>The physicians of the 14th century,
during the Black Death, did what human
intellect could do in the actual condition
of the healing art; and their knowledge
of the disease was by no means despicable.
They, like the rest of mankind, have
indulged in prejudices, and defended them,
perhaps, with too much obstinacy: some
of these, however, were founded in the
mode of thinking of the age, and passed
current in those days, as established truths:
others continue to exist to the present
hour.</p>

<p>Their successors in the 19th century,
ought not therefore to vaunt too highly
the pre-eminence of their knowledge, for<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
they too will be subjected to the severe
judgment of posterity&mdash;they too, will,
with reason, be accused of human weakness
and want of foresight.</p>

<p>The medical faculty of Paris, the most
celebrated of the 14th century, were commissioned
to deliver their opinion on the
causes of the Black Plague, together with
some appropriate regulations with regard
to living, during its prevalence. This document
is sufficiently remarkable to find
a place here.</p>

<p>“We, the Members of the College of
Physicians, of Paris, have, after mature
consideration and consultation on the present
mortality, collected the advice of our
old masters in the art, and intend to
make known the causes of this pestilence,
more clearly than could be done according
to the rules and principles of astrology
and natural science; we, therefore, declare
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is known that in India, and the
vicinity of the Great Sea, the constella<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>tions
which combated the rays of the
sun, and the warmth of the heavenly fire,
exerted their power especially against
that sea, and struggled violently with
its waters. Hence, vapours often originate
which envelope the sun, and convert his
light into darkness. These vapours alternately
rose and fell for twenty-eight days;
but at last, sun and fire acted so powerfully
upon the sea, that they attracted a great
portion of it to themselves, and the waters
of the ocean arose in the form of vapour;
thereby the waters were in some parts,
so corrupted, that the fish which they
contained, died. These corrupted waters,
however, the heat of the sun could not
consume, neither could other wholesome
water, hail or snow, and dew, originate
therefrom. On the contrary, this vapour
spread itself through the air in many
places on the earth, and enveloped them
in fog.</p>

<p>“Such was the case all over Arabia, in a
part of India; in Crete; in the plains and<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
valleys of Macedonia; in Hungary; Albania
and Sicily. Should the same thing
occur in Sardinia, not a man will be
left alive; and the like will continue, so
long as the sun remains in the sign of
Leo, on all the islands and adjoining
countries to which this corrupted sea-wind
extends, or has already extended from
India. If the inhabitants of those parts do
not employ and adhere to the following, or
similar means and precepts, we announce
to them inevitable death&mdash;except the
grace of Christ preserve their lives.</p>

<p>“We are of opinion, that the constellations,
with the aid of Nature, strive, by
virtue of their divine might, to protect and
heal the human race; and to this end,
in union with the rays of the sun, acting
through the power of fire, endeavour to
break through the mist. Accordingly,
within the next ten days, and until the
17th of the ensuing month of July, this
mist will be converted into a stinking
deleterious rain, whereby the air will be<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
much purified. Now, as soon as this rain
announces itself, by thunder or hail, every
one of you should protect himself from
the air; and, as well before as after the
rain, kindle a large fire of vine-wood,
green laurel, or other green wood; wormwood
and chamomile should also be burnt
in great quantity in the market places,
in other densely inhabited localities, and in
the houses. Until the earth is again completely
dry, and for three days afterwards,
no one ought to go abroad in the fields.
During this time the diet should be simple,
and people should be cautious in avoiding
exposure in the cool of the evening, at
night, and in the morning. Poultry and
water-fowl, young pork, old beef, and fat
meat, in general, should not be eaten; but
on the contrary, meat of a proper age, of
a warm and dry nature, by no means, however,
heating and exciting. Broth should
be taken, seasoned with ground pepper,
ginger and cloves, especially by those who
are accustomed to live temperately, and<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
are yet choice in their diet. Sleep in the
day-time is detrimental; it should be taken
at night until sun-rise, or somewhat longer.
At breakfast, one should drink little; supper
should be taken an hour before sun-set,
when more may be drunk than in the
morning. Clear light wine, mixed with a
fifth or sixth part of water, should be used
as a beverage. Dried or fresh fruits with
wine are not injurious; but highly so
without it. Beet-root and other vegetables,
whether eaten pickled or fresh, are hurtful;
on the contrary, spicy pot-herbs, as sage
or rosemary, are wholesome. Cold, moist,
watery food is, in general, prejudicial.
Going out at night, and even until three
o’clock in the morning, is dangerous, on
account of the dew. Only small river fish
should be used. Too much exercise is
hurtful. The body should be kept warmer
than usual, and thus protected from
moisture and cold. Rain-water must not
be employed in cooking, and every one
should guard against exposure to wet<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
weather. If it rain, a little fine treacle
should be taken after dinner. Fat people
should not sit in the sunshine. Good
clear wine should be selected and drunk
often, but in small quantities, by day.
Olive oil, as an article of food, is fatal.
Equally injurious are fasting or excessive
abstemiousness, anxiety of mind, anger,
and excessive drinking. Young people,
in autumn especially, must abstain from
all these things, if they do not wish
to run a risk of dying of dysentery. In
order to keep the body properly open, an
enema, or some other simple means, should
be employed, when necessary. Bathing is
injurious. Men must preserve chastity as
they value their lives. Every one should
impress this on his recollection, but especially
those who reside on the coast,
or upon an island into which the noxious
wind has penetrated.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p>

<p>On what occasion these strange precepts
were delivered can no longer be
ascertained, even if it were an object to
know it. It must be acknowledged, however,
that they do not redound to the
credit either of the faculty of Paris, or
of the 14th century in general. This
famous faculty found themselves under
the painful necessity of being wise at
command, and of firing a point blank
shot of erudition at an enemy who enveloped
himself in a dark mist, of the
nature of which they had no conception.
In concealing their ignorance by authoritative
assertions, they suffered themselves,
therefore, to be misled; and while endeavouring
to appear to the world with eclat,
only betrayed to the intelligent their
lamentable weakness. Now some might
suppose, that in the condition of the
sciences in the 14th century, no intelligent
physicians existed; but this is altogether
at variance with the laws of human
advancement, and is contradicted by his<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>tory.
The real knowledge of an age, is only
shown in the archives of its literature.
Men of talent here alone deposit the
results of their experience and reflection,
without vanity or a selfish object:&mdash;here
alone the genius of truth speaks audibly.
There is no ground for believing that, in
the 14th century, men of this kind were
publicly questioned regarding their views;
and it is, therefore, the more necessary
that impartial history should take up their
cause and do justice to their merits.</p>

<p>The first notice on this subject is due
to a very celebrated teacher in Perugia,
Gentilis of Foligno, who, on the 18th of
June, 1348, fell a sacrifice to the plague,
in the faithful discharge of his duty<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span>
Attached to Arabian doctrines, and to the
universally respected Galen, he, in common
with all his contemporaries, believed
in a putrid corruption of the blood in the<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
lungs and in the heart, which was occasioned
by the pestilential atmosphere, and
was forthwith communicated to the whole
body. He thought, therefore, that everything
depended upon a sufficient purification
of the air, by means of large
blazing fires of odoriferous wood, in the
vicinity of the healthy, as well as of the
sick, and also upon an appropriate manner
of living; so that the putridity might
not overpower the diseased. In conformity
with notions derived from the ancients, he
depended upon bleeding and purging, at
the commencement of the attack, for the
purpose of purification; ordered the healthy
to wash themselves frequently with vinegar
or wine, to sprinkle their dwellings with
vinegar, and to smell often to camphor, or
other volatile substances. Hereupon he
gave, after the Arabian fashion, detailed
rules, with an abundance of different medicines,
of whose healing powers wonderful
things were believed. He laid little
stress upon super-lunar influences, so far<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
as respected the malady itself; on which
account, he did not enter into the great
controversies of the astrologers, but always
kept in view, as an object of medical attention,
the corruption of the blood in the
lungs and heart. He believed in a progressive
infection from country to country, according
to the notions of the present day;
and the contagious power of the disease,
even in the vicinity of those affected by
plague, was, in his opinion, beyond all
doubt<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> On this point, intelligent contemporaries
were all agreed; and in truth,
it required no great genius to be convinced
of so palpable a fact. Besides,
correct notions of contagion have descended
from remote antiquity, and were
maintained unchanged in the 14th century<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span>
So far back as the age of Plato,<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
a knowledge of the contagious power
of malignant inflammations of the eye,
of which also no physician of the middle
ages entertained a doubt<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> was general
among the people<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> yet, in modern times,
surgeons have filled volumes with partial
controversies on this subject. The whole
language of antiquity has adapted itself
to the notions of the people, respecting
the contagion of pestilential diseases; and
their terms were, beyond comparison, more
expressive than those in use among the
moderns<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span></p>

<p>Arrangements for the protection of the
healthy against contagious diseases, the<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
necessity of which is shewn from these
notions, were regarded by the ancients
as useful; and by many, whose circumstances
permitted it, were carried into effect
in their houses. Even a total separation
of the sick from the healthy, that indispensable
means of protection against infection
by contact, was proposed by physicians
of the 2nd century after Christ,
in order to check the spreading of leprosy.
But it was decidedly opposed, because,
as it was alleged, the healing art ought
not to be guilty of such harshness<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>
This mildness of the ancients, in whose
manner of thinking inhumanity was so
often and so undisguisedly conspicuous,
might excite surprise, if it were anything
more than apparent. The true ground
of the neglect of public protection against
pestilential diseases, lay in the general<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
notion and constitution of human society,&mdash;it
lay in the disregard of human life,
of which the great nations of antiquity
have given proofs in every page of their
history. Let it not be supposed that they
wanted knowledge respecting the propagation
of contagious diseases. On the contrary,
they were as well informed on this
subject as the moderns; but this was
shewn where individual property, not
where human life, on the grand scale,
was to be protected. Hence the ancients
made a general practice of arresting the
progress of murrains among cattle, by a
separation of the diseased from the healthy.
Their herds alone enjoyed that protection
which they held it impracticable to
extend to human society, because they
had no wish to do so<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> That the governments
in the 14th century, were not yet
so far advanced, as to put into practice
general regulations for checking the plague,<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
needs no especial proof. Physicians could,
therefore, only advise public purifications
of the air by means of large fires, as
had often been practised in ancient times;
and they were obliged to leave it to individual
families, either to seek safety in
flight, or to shut themselves up in their
dwellings<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> a method which answers in
common plagues, but which here afforded
no complete security, because such was
the fury of the disease when it was at its
height, that the atmosphere of whole cities
was penetrated by the infection.</p>

<p>Of the astral influence which was considered
to have originated the “Great
Mortality,” physicians and learned men<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
were as completely convinced as of the
fact of its reality. A grand conjunction
of the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter
and Mars, in the sign of Aquarius,
which took place according to Guy de
Chauliac, on the 24th of March, 1345,
was generally received as its principal
cause. In fixing the day, this physician,
who was deeply versed in astrology, did
not agree with others; whereupon there
arose various disputations, of weight in
that age, but of none in ours; people,
however, agreed in this&mdash;that conjunctions
of the planets infallibly prognosticated
great events; great revolutions of kingdoms,
new prophets, destructive plagues,
and other occurrences which bring distress
and horror on mankind. No medical
author of the 14th and 15th century, omits
an opportunity of representing them as
among the general prognostics of great
plagues; nor can we, for our parts, regard
the astrology of the middle ages, as a
mere offspring of superstition. It has not<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
only, in common with all ideas which inspire
and guide mankind, a high historical
importance, entirely independent of its
error or truth&mdash;for the influence of both
is equally powerful&mdash;but there are also
contained in it, as in alchymy, grand
thoughts of antiquity, of which modern
natural philosophy is so little ashamed that
she claims them as her property. Foremost
among these, is the idea of the
general life which diffuses itself throughout
the whole universe, expressed by the
greatest Greek sages, and transmitted to
the middle ages, through the new Platonic
natural philosophy. To this impression of
an universal organism, the assumption of
a reciprocal influence of terrestrial bodies
could not be foreign<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> nor did this cease
to correspond with a higher view of nature,
until astrologers overstepped the limits<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
of human knowledge with frivolous and
mystical calculations.</p>

<p>Guy de Chauliac, considers the influence
of the conjunction, which was held
to be all-potent, as the chief general cause
of the Black Plague; the diseased state
of bodies, the corruption of the fluids,
debility, obstruction, and so forth, as the
especial subordinate causes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> By these,
according to his opinion, the quality of
the air, and of the other elements, was
so altered, that they set poisonous fluids
in motion towards the inward parts of
the body, in the same manner as the
magnet attracts iron; whence there arose
in the commencement fever and the
spitting of blood; afterwards, however, a
deposition in the form of glandular swellings
and inflammatory boils. Herein the
notion of an epidemic constitution was
set forth, clearly and conformably, to the
spirit of the age. Of contagion, Guy de<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
Chauliac was completely convinced. He
sought to protect himself against it by
the usual means<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> and it was probably
he who advised Pope Clement VI. to
shut himself up while the plague lasted.
The preservation of this pope’s life, however,
was most beneficial to the city of
Avignon, for he loaded the poor with
judicious acts of kindness,&mdash;took care to
have proper attendants provided, and paid
physicians himself to afford assistance
wherever human aid could avail; an advantage
which, perhaps, no other city
enjoyed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> Nor was the treatment of<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
plague patients in Avignon by any means
objectionable; for, after the usual depletions
by bleeding and aperients, where circumstances
required them, they endeavoured
to bring the buboes to suppuration; they
made incisions into the inflammatory boils,
or burned them with a red-hot iron, a practice
which at all times proves salutary,
and in the Black Plague saved many lives.
In this city, the Jews, who lived in a state
of the greatest filth, were most severely
visited, as also the Spaniards, whom Chalin
accuses of great intemperance<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span></p>

<p>Still more distinct notions on the causes
of the plague were stated to his contemporaries
in the 14th century, by Galeazzo
di Santa Sofia, a learned man, a
native of Padua, who likewise treated
plague-patients at Vienna<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> though in
what year is undetermined. He distinguishes
carefully <i>pestilence</i> from <i>epidemie</i>
and <i>endemie</i>. The common notion of the<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
two first accords exactly with that of an
epidemic constitution, for both consist,
according to him, in an unknown change
or corruption of the air; with this difference,
that <i>pestilence</i> calls forth diseases
of different kinds; <i>epidemie</i>, on the contrary,
always the same disease. As an
example of an <i>epidemie</i>, he adduces a
cough (influenza) which was observed in
all climates at the same time, without
perceptible cause; but he recognized the
approach of a <i>pestilence</i>, independently of
unusual natural phenomena, by the more
frequent occurrence of various kinds of
fever, to which the modern physicians
would assign a nervous and putrid character.
The <i>endemie</i> originates, according
to him, only in local telluric changes&mdash;in
deleterious influences which develope
themselves in the earth and in the water,
without a corruption of the air. These
notions were variously jumbled together in
his time, like everything which human understanding
separates by too fine a line<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
of limitation. The estimation of cosmical
influences, however, in the <i>epidemie</i> and
<i>pestilence</i>, is well worthy of commendation;
and Santa Sofia, in this respect, not only
agrees with the most intelligent persons
of the 14th and 15th centuries, but he
has also promulgated an opinion which
must, even now, serve as a foundation
for our scarcely commenced investigations
into cosmical influences<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> <i>Pestilence</i> and
<i>epidemie</i>, consist, not in alterations of the
four primary qualities<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> but in a corruption
of the air, powerful, though quite
immaterial, and not cognoscible by the
senses: (corruptio aëris non substantialis,
sed qualitativa) in a disproportion of
the imponderables in the atmosphere, as
it would be expressed by the moderns<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span>
The causes of the <i>pestilence</i> and <i>epidemie</i>
are, first of all, astral influences, especially
on occasion of planetary conjunctions;
then extensive putrefaction of animal
and vegetable bodies, and terrestrial corruptions
(corruptio in terra); to which also,
bad diet and want may contribute. Santa
Sofia considers the putrefaction of locusts,
that had perished in the sea, and were
again thrown up, combined with astral
and terrestrial influences, as the cause of
the pestilence in the eventful year of the
“Great Mortality.”</p>

<p>All the fevers which were called forth
by the <i>pestilence</i>, are, according to him,
of the putrid kind; for they originate prin<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>cipally
from putridity of the heart’s blood,
which inevitably follows the inhalation of
infected air. The Oriental Plague is,
sometimes, but by no means always, occasioned
by <i>pestilence</i> (?), which imparts to it
a character (qualitas occulta) hostile to
human nature. It originates frequently from
other causes, among which, this physician
was aware that contagion was to be
reckoned; and it deserves to be remarked,
that he held epidemic small-pox and
measles to be infallible forerunners of the
plague, as do the physicians and people
of the <span class="nowrap">East<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> at the present day.</p>

<p>In the exposition of his therapeutical
views of the plague, a clearness of intellect
is again shewn by Santa Sofia,
which reflects credit on the age. It seemed
to him to depend, 1st, on an evacuation
of putrid matters, by purgatives and bleeding:
yet he did not sanction the employment
of these means indiscriminately,<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
and without consideration; least of all
where the condition of the blood was
healthy. He also declared himself decidedly
against bleeding ad deliquium (venæ
sectio eradicativa). 2d, Strengthening of
the heart and prevention of putrescence.
3d, Appropriate regimen. 4th, Improvement
of the air. 5th, Appropriate treatment
of tumid glands and inflammatory
boils, with emollient, or even stimulating
poultices (mustard, lily-bulbs), as well
as with red-hot gold and iron. Lastly,
6th, Attention to prominent symptoms.
The stores of the Arabian pharmacy,
which he brought into action to meet
all these indications, were indeed very
considerable; it is to be observed, however,
that, for the most part, gentle means
were accumulated, which in case of abuse,
would do no harm; for the character of
the Arabian system of medicine, whose
principles were everywhere followed at
this time, was mildness and caution.
On this account too, we cannot believe<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
that a very prolix treatise by Marsigli
di Santa Sofia<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> a contemporary relative
of Galeazzo, on the prevention and treatment
of plague, can have caused much
harm, although, perhaps, even in the 14th
century, an agreeable latitude and confident
assertions respecting things which
no mortal has investigated, or which it
is quite a matter of indifference to distinguish,
were considered as proofs of a
valuable practical talent.</p>

<p>The agreement of contemporary and later
writers, shews that the published views
of the most celebrated physicians of the
14th century, were those generally adopted.
Among these, Chalin de Vinario is the
most experienced. Though devoted to
astrology, still more than his distinguished
contemporary, he acknowledges the great
power of terrestrial influences, and expresses
himself very sensibly on the indisputable
doctrine of contagion, endeavouring<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
thereby to apologize for many surgeons
and physicians of his time, who neglected
their duty<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> He asserted boldly,
and with truth, “<i>that all epidemic diseases
might become contagious<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> and all fevers<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
epidemic</i>,” which attentive observers of all
subsequent ages have confirmed.</p>

<p>He delivered his sentiments on blood-letting
with sagacity, as an experienced
physician; yet he was unable, as may
be imagined, to moderate the desire for
bleeding shewn by the ignorant monks.
He was averse to draw blood from the
veins of patients under fourteen years of
age; but counteracted inflammatory excitement
in them by cupping; and endeavoured
to moderate the inflammation
of the tumid glands by leeches<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> Most
of those who were bled, died; he therefore
reserved this remedy for the plethoric;
especially for the papal courtiers,
and the hypocritical priests, whom he
saw gratifying their sensual desires, and
imitating Epicurus, whilst they pompously
pretended to follow Christ<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> He recom<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>mended
burning the boils with a red-hot
iron, only in the plague without fever, which
occurred in single cases<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> and was always
ready to correct those over-hasty surgeons,
who, with fire and violent remedies, did irremediable
injury to their patients<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> Michael
Savonarola, professor in Ferrara (1462), reasoning
on the susceptibility of the human
frame to the influence of pestilential infection,
as the cause of such various modifications
of disease, expresses himself as a
modern physician would on this point; and
an adoption of the principle of contagion,
was the foundation of his definition of the
plague<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> No less worthy of observation are
the views of the celebrated Valescus of Taranta,
who, during the final visitation of the<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
Black Death, in 1382, practised as a physician
at Montpellier, and handed down to posterity
what has been repeated in innumerable
treatises on plague, which were written
during the 15th and 16th centuries<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span></p>

<p>Of all these notions and views regarding
the plague, whose development we
have represented, there are two especially,
which are prominent in historical importance:&mdash;1st,
The opinion of learned physicians,
that the <i>pestilence</i>, or epidemic constitution,
is the <i>parent of various kinds
of disease</i>; that the plague sometimes,
indeed, but by no means always, originates
from it: that, to speak in the language
of the moderns, <i>the pestilence</i> bears the
same relation to contagion, that a predisposing
cause does to an occasional
cause: and 2dly, the universal conviction
of the contagious power of that disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span></p>

<p>Contagion gradually attracted more notice:
it was thought that in it, the most powerful
occasional cause might be avoided;
the possibility of protecting whole cities by
separation, became gradually more evident;
and so horrifying was the recollection of the
eventful year of the “<i>Great Mortality</i>,” that
before the close of the 14th century, ere the
ill effects of the Black Plague had ceased,
nations endeavoured to guard against the
return of this enemy, by an earnest and
effectual defence.</p>

<p>The first regulation which was issued
for this purpose, originated with Viscount
Bernabo, and is dated the 17th Jan.
1374. “Every plague patient was to be
taken out of the city into the fields, there
to die or to recover. Those who attended
upon a plague patient, were to remain
apart for ten days, before they again
associated with any body. The priests
were to examine the diseased, and point
out to special commissioners, the persons<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
infected; under punishment of the confiscation
of their goods, and of being burned
alive. Whoever imported the plague, the
state condemned his goods to confiscation.
Finally, none except those who were appointed
for that purpose, were to attend
plague-patients, under penalty of death
and confiscation<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span></p>

<p>These orders, in correspondence with the
spirit of the 14th century, are sufficiently
decided to indicate a recollection of the
good effects of confinement, and of keeping
at a distance those suspected of having
plague. It was said that Milan itself, by a
rigorous barricado of three houses in which
the plague had broken out, maintained itself
free from the “<i>Great Mortality</i>,” for a considerable
time<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> and examples of the preser<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>vation
of individual families, by means of
a strict separation, were certainly very frequent.
That these orders must have caused
universal affliction from their uncommon severity,
as we know to have been especially
the case in the city of Reggio, may be easily
conceived; but Bernabo did not suffer himself
to be frightened from his purpose&mdash;on
the contrary, when the plague returned
in the year 1383, he forbad the admission
of people from infected places into his
territories, on pain of death<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> We have
now, it is true, no account how far he
succeeded; yet it is to be supposed that
he arrested the disease, for it had long
lost the property of the Black Death, to
spread abroad in the air the contagious
matter which proceeded from the lungs,
charged with putridity, and to taint the
atmosphere of whole cities by the vast<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
numbers of the sick. Now that it had
resumed its milder form, so that it infected
only by contact, it admitted being
confined within individual dwellings, as
easily as in modern times.</p>

<p>Bernabo’s example was imitated; nor
was there any century more appropriate
for recommending to governments strong
regulations against the plague, than the
14th; for when it broke out in Italy,
in the year 1399, and still demanded new
victims, it was for the 16th time; without
reckoning frequent visitations of measles
and small-pox. In this same year, Viscount
John, in milder terms than his predecessor,
ordered that no stranger should
be admitted from infected places, and
that the city gates should be strictly
guarded. Infected houses were to be ventilated
for at least eight or ten days,
and purified from noxious vapours by
fires, and by fumigations with balsamic
and aromatic substances. Straw, rags,
and the like, were to be burned; and<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
the bedsteads which had been used, set
out for four days in the rain or the sunshine,
so that, by means of the one or the other,
the morbific vapour might be destroyed.
No one was to venture to make use of
clothes or beds out of infected dwellings,
unless they had been previously washed
and dried either at the fire or in the sun.
People were, likewise, to avoid, as long as
possible, occupying houses which had been
frequented by plague-patients<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot precisely perceive in these an
advance towards general regulations; and
perhaps people were convinced of the insurmountable
impediments which opposed the
separation of open inland countries, where
bodies of people connected together could
not be brought, even by the most obdurate
severity, to renounce the habit of a profitable
intercourse.</p>

<p>Doubtless it is Nature which has done
the most to banish the Oriental plague from<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
western Europe, where the increasing cultivation
of the earth, and the advancing order
in civilized society, prevented it from
remaining domesticated; which it most probably
had been in the more ancient times.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, during which
it broke out seventeen times in different
places in <span class="nowrap">Europe<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>, it was of the more consequence
to oppose a barrier to its entrance
from Asia, Africa, and Greece (which had
become Turkish); for it would have been
difficult for it to maintain itself indigenously
any longer. Among the southern commercial
states, however, which were called on to
make the greatest exertions to this end, it
was principally Venice, formerly so severely
attacked by the black plague, that put
the necessary restraint upon the perilous
profits of the merchant. Until towards the
end of the fifteenth century, the very considerable
intercourse with the East was free
and unimpeded. Ships of commercial cities
had often brought over the plague: nay,<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
the former irruption of the <i>great mortality</i>
itself had been occasioned by navigators.
For, as in the latter end of Autumn, 1347,
four ships full of plague-patients returned
from the Levant to Genoa, the disease
spread itself there with astonishing rapidity.
On this account, in the following year, the
Genoese forbid the entrance of suspected
ships into their port. These sailed to Pisa
and other cities on the coast, where already
Nature had made such mighty preparations
for the reception of the Black Plague,
and what we have already described took
place in consequence<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1485, when, among the cities
of northern Italy, Milan especially felt the
scourge of the plague, a special council of
health, consisting of three nobles, was established
at Venice, who probably tried
every thing in their power to prevent the
entrance of this disease, and gradually
called into activity all those regulations<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
which have served in later times as a pattern
for the other southern states of Europe.
Their endeavours were, however, not
crowned with complete success; on which
account their powers were increased, in the
year 1504, by granting them the right of
life and death over those who violated the
regulations<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> Bills of health were probably
first introduced in the year 1527, during a
fatal <span class="nowrap">plague<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span> which visited Italy for five
years (1525–30), and called forth redoubled
caution.</p>

<p>The first lazarettos were established upon
islands at some distance from the city,
seemingly as early as the year 1485. Here
all strangers coming from places where the
existence of plague was suspected were detained.
If it appeared in the city itself, the
sick were despatched with their families
to what was called the Old Lazaretto,
were there furnished with provisions and<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
medicines, and, when they were cured,
were detained, together with all those who
had had intercourse with them, still forty
days longer in the New Lazaretto, situated
on another island. All these regulations
were every year improved, and their needful
rigour was increased, so that from the
year 1585 onwards no appeal was allowed
from the sentence of the Council of Health;
and the other commercial nations gradually
came to the support of the Venetians, by
adopting corresponding regulations<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> Bills
of health, however, were not general until
the year 1665<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span></p>

<p>The appointment of a forty days’ detention,
whence quarantines derive their name,
was not dictated by caprice, but probably
had a medical origin, which is derivable in
part from the doctrine of critical days; for
the fortieth day, according to the most an<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>cient
notions, has been always regarded as
the last of ardent diseases, and the limit of
separation between these and those which
are chronic. It was the custom to subject
lying-in women for forty days to a more
exact superintendance. There was a good
deal also said in medical works of forty
day epochs in the formation of the fœtus,
not to mention that the alchymists expected
more durable revolutions in forty days,
which period they called the philosophical
month.</p>

<p>This period being generally held to
prevail in natural processes, it appeared
reasonable to assume and legally to establish
it as that required for the development
of latent principles of contagion,
since public regulations cannot dispense
with decisions of this kind, even though
they should not be wholly justified by
the nature of the case. Great stress has
likewise been laid on theological and legal
grounds which were certainly of greater<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
weight in the fifteenth century than in
more modern times<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span></p>

<p>On this matter, however, we cannot decide,
since our only object here is to point
out the origin of a political means of protection
against a disease, which has been the
greatest impediment to civilization within
the memory of man; a means, that, like
Jenner’s vaccine after the small-pox had
ravaged Europe for twelve hundred years,
has diminished the check which mortality
puts on the progress of civilization, and thus
given to the life and manners of the nations
of this part of the world a new direction,
the result of which we cannot foretel.</p>

<p class="pl1hi"><i>Answer from the Castellan of Chillon to the City of
Strasburg, together with a Copy of the Inquisition
and Confession of several Jews confined in the Castle
of Chillon on suspicion of poison. Anno 1348.</i></p>

<p>To the Honorable the Mayor, Senate and Citizens
of the City of Strasburg, the Castellan of Chillon, Deputy
of the Bailiff of Chablais, sendeth greeting with
all due submission and respect.</p>

<p>Understanding that you desire to be made acquainted
with the confession of the Jews, and the proofs
brought forward against them, I certify, by these presents,
to you, and each of you that desires to be in<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>formed,
that they of Berne have had a copy of the inquisition
and confession of the Jews who lately resided
in the places specified, and who were accused of putting
poison into the wells and several other places: as
also the most conclusive evidence of the truth of the
charge preferred against them. Many Jews were put
to the question, others being excused from it, because
they confessed, and were brought to trial and burnt.
Several Christians, also, who had poïson given them
by the Jews for the purpose of destroying the Christians,
were put on the wheel and tortured. This burning
of the Jews and torturing of the said Christians
took place in many parts of the county of Savoy.</p>

<p class="sig">Fare you well.”</p>

<p class="pl1hi"><i>The Confession made on the 15th day of September, in
the year of our Lord 1348, in the Castle of Chillon,
by the Jews arrested in Neustadt, on the
Charge of Poisoning the Wells, Springs and other
places; also Food &amp;c., with the Design of destroying
and extirpating all Christians.</i></p>

<p>I. Balavignus, a Jewish physician, inhabitant of
Thonon, was arrested at Chillon in consequence of
being found in the neighbourhood. He was put for a
short time to the rack, and, on being taken down, confessed,
after much hesitation, that, about ten weeks before,
the Rabbi Jacob of Toledo, who because of a cita<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>tion,
had resided at Chamberi since Easter, sent him,
by a Jewish boy, some poison in the mummy of an egg:
it was a powder sewed up in a thin leathern pouch accompanied
by a letter, commanding him, on penalty of
excommunication, and by his required obedience to the
law, to throw this poison into the larger and more
frequented wells of the town of Thonon, to poison
those who drew water there. He was further enjoined
not to communicate the circumstance to any person
whatever, under the same penalty. In conformity with
this command of the Jewish rabbis and doctors of the
law, he, Balavignus, distributed the poison in several
places, and acknowledged having one evening placed a
certain portion under a stone in a spring on the shore
at Thonon. He further confessed that the said boy
brought various letters of a similar import, addressed
to others of his nation, and particularly specified some
directed severally to Mossoiet, Banditon, and Samoleto
of Neustadt; to Musseo Abramo and Aquetus of
Montreantz, Jews residing at Thurn in Vivey; to Benetonus
and his son at St. Moritz; to Vivianus Jacobus,
Aquetus and Sonetus, Jews at Aquani. Several
letters of a like nature were sent to Abram and Musset,
Jews at Moncheoli; and the boy told him that he had
taken many others to different and distant places, but
he did not recollect to whom they were addressed.
Balavignus further confessed that, after having put the
poison into the spring at Thonon, he had positively
forbidden his wife and children to drink the water, but<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
had not thought fit to assign a reason. He avowed the
truth of this statement, and, in the presence of several
credible witnesses, swore by his Law, and the Five
Books of Moses to every item of his deposition.</p>

<p>On the day following, Balavignus, voluntarily and
without torture, ratified the above confession verbatim
before many persons of character, and, of his own accord,
acknowledged that, on returning one day from
Tour near Vivey, he had thrown into a well below Mustruez,
namely that of La Conerayde, a quantity of the
poison tied up in a rag, given to him for the purpose by
Aquetus of Montreantz, an inhabitant of the said Tour:
that he had acquainted Manssiono, and his son Delosaz,
residents of Neustadt, with the circumstance of
his having done so, and advertised them not to drink
of the water. He described the colour of the poison
as being red and black.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth day of September, the above-named
Balavignus confessed, without torture, that
about three weeks after Whitsuntide, a Jew named
Mussus told him that he had thrown poison into
the well in the custom-house of that place, the property
of the Borneller family; and that he no longer drank
the water of this well, but that of the lake. He further
deposed that Mussus informed him that he had
also laid some of the poison under the stones in the
custom-house at Chillon. Search was accordingly
made in this well, and the poison found: some of it
was given to a Jew by way of trial, and he died in con<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>sequence.
He also stated that the rabbis had ordered
him and other Jews to refrain from drinking of the
water for nine days after the poison was infused into it;
and, immediately on having poisoned the waters, he
communicated the circumstance to the other Jews.
He, Balavignus, confessed that about two months previously,
being at Evian, he had some conversation on
the subject with a Jew called Jacob, and, among other
things, asked him whether he also had received writings
and poison, and was answered in the affirmative;
he then questioned him whether he had obeyed the
command, and Jacob replied that he had not, but had
given the poison to Savetus, a Jew, who had thrown it
into the Well de Morer at Evian. Jacob also desired
him, Balavignus, to execute the command imposed on
him with due caution. He confessed that Aquetus of
Montreantz had informed him that he had thrown
some of the poison into the well above Tour, the water
of which he sometimes drank. He confessed that Samolet
had told him that he had laid the poison which
he had received in a well, which, however, he refused
to name to him. Balavignus, as a physician, further
deposed that a person infected by such poison coming
in contact with another while in a state of perspiration,
infection would be the almost inevitable result; as
might also happen from the breath of an infected person.
This fact he believed to be correct, and was confirmed
in his opinion by the attestation of many experienced
physicians. He also declared that none of his<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
community could exculpate themselves from this accusation,
as the plot was communicated to all; and that
all were guilty of the above charges. Balavignus was
conveyed over the lake from Chillon to Clarens, to point
out the well into which he confessed having thrown the
powder. On landing, he was conducted to the spot;
and, having seen the well, acknowledged that to be the
place, saying, “This is the well into which I put the poison.”
The well was examined in his presence, and
the linen cloth in which the poison had been wrapped
was found in the waste-pipe by a notary-public named
Heinrich Gerhard, in the presence of many persons,
and was shewn to the said Jew. He acknowledged
this to be the linen which had contained the poison,
which he described as being of two colours, red and
black, but said that he had thrown it into the open
well. The linen cloth was taken away and is preserved.</p>

<p>Balavignus, in conclusion, attests the truth of all
and every thing as above related. He believes this
poison to contain a portion of the basilisk, because he
had heard, and felt assured, that the above poison
could not be prepared without it.</p>


<p>II. Banditono, a Jew of Neustadt, was, on the fifteenth
day of September, subjected for a short time to
the torture. After a long interval, he confessed having
cast a quantity of poison, about the size of a large nut,
given him by Musseus, a Jew, at Tour near Vivey,
into the well of Carutet, in order to poison those who
drank of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span></p>

<p>The following day, Banditono, voluntarily and without
torture, attested the truth of the aforesaid deposition;
and also confessed that the Rabbi Jacob von Pasche,
who came from Toledo and had settled at Chamberi,
sent him, at Pilliex, by a Jewish servant, some poison
about the size of a large nut, together with a letter, directing
him to throw the powder into the wells on pain
of excommunication. He had therefore thrown the
poison, which was sewn up in a leathern bag, into the
well of Cercliti de Roch; further, also, that he saw
many other letters in the hands of the servant addressed
to different Jews; that he had also seen the said servant
deliver one, on the outside of the upper gate, to
Samuletus, the Jew, at Neustadt. He stated, also,
that the Jew Massolet had informed him that he had
put poison into the well near the bridge at Vivey.</p>


<p>III. The said Manssiono, Jew of Neustadt, was put
upon the rack on the fifteenth day of the same month,
but refused to admit the above charge, protesting his
entire ignorance of the whole matter; but the day following,
he, voluntarily and without any torture, confessed,
in the presence of many persons, that he came
from Mancheolo one day in last Whitsunweek, in company
with a Jew named Provenzal, and, on reaching
the well of Chabloz Crüez between Vyona and Mura,
the latter said, “You must put some of the poison which
I will give you into that well, or woe betide you!” He
therefore took a portion of the powder about the big<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>ness
of a nut, and did as he was directed. He believed
that the Jews in the neighbourhood of Evian had convened
a council among themselves relative to this plot,
before Whitsuntide. He further said that Balavignus
had informed him of his having poisoned the Well de
la Conerayde below Mustruez. He also affirmed his
conviction of the culpability of the Jews in this affair,
stating that they were fully acquainted with all the
particulars, and guilty of the alleged crime.</p>

<p>On the third day of the October following, Manssiono
was brought before the commissioners, and did not in
the least vary from his former deposition, or deny having
put the poison into the said wells.</p>

<p>The above-named Jews, prior to their execution, solemnly
swore by their Law to the truth of their several
depositions, and declared that all Jews whatsoever,
from seven years old and upwards, could not be exempted
from the charge of guilt, as all of them were
acquainted with the plot, and more or less participators
in the crime.</p>

<p>[<i>The seven other examinations scarcely differ from the
above, except in the names of the accused, and afford
but little variety. We will, therefore, only add a characteristic
passage at the conclusion of this document.
The whole speaks for itself.</i>]</p>

<p>There still remain numerous proofs and accusations
against the above-mentioned Jews: also against Jews
and Christians in different parts of the county of Savoy,
who have already received the punishment due to their<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
heinous crime; which, however, I have not at hand,
and cannot therefore send you. I must add that all
the Jews of Neustadt were burnt according to the just
sentence of the law. At Augst, I was present when
three Christians were flayed on account of being accessory
to the plot of poisoning. Very many Christians
were arrested for this crime in various places in this
country, especially at Evian, Gebenne, Krusilien and
Hochstett, who, at last and in their dying moments,
were brought to confess and acknowledge that they
had received the poison from the Jews. Of these
Christians some have been quartered; others flayed
and afterwards hanged. Certain commissioners have
been appointed by the magistrates to enforce judgment
against all the Jews; and I believe that none
will escape.</p>

<p class="tac fwb mrl15 ti0">Extracts from “A Boke or Counseill against the Disease
commonly called the Sweate or Sweatyng Sicknesse,”
made by John Caius, Doctour in Phisicke.&mdash;
Emprinted at London. A. D. 1552.</p>

<hr class="r5a" />

<p>“Hetherto I haue shewed the beginning, name, nature
&amp; signes of this disease: now I will declare the
causes, which be ii: infection, &amp; impure spirites in
bodies corrupt by repletion. Infection, by th’aire receiuing
euel qualities, distempring not only y<sup>e</sup> hete,
but the hole substance thereof, in putrifieng the same,
&amp; that generally ii waies. By the time of the yere
vnnatural, and by the nature and site of the soile &amp;
region . whereunto maye be put the particular accidentes
of this same. By the time of the yeare vnnaturall,
as if winter be hot &amp; drie, somer hot &amp; moist (a
fit time for sweates) the spring colde and drye, the
fall hot &amp; moist. To this mai be ioyned the euel disposition
by constellation, whiche hath a great power
&amp; dominion in al erthly thinges. By the site &amp; nature
of the soile &amp; region, many wayes. First and specially,
by euel mistes &amp; exhalations drawen out of the grounde
by the sunne in the heate of the yeare, as chanced<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
among the Grekes in the siege of Troy, whereby died
firste dogges &amp; mules, after, men in great numbre:
&amp; here also in England in this <span class="lowercase smcap">M.D.L.I.</span> yeare, the cause
of this pestilent sweate, but of dyuers nature. Whiche
miste in the countrie wher it began, was sene flie from
toune to toune, with suche a stincke in morninges &amp;
euenings, that men could scarcely abide it. Then by
dampes out of the earth, as out of Galenes Barathrum,
or the poetes auernum, or aornum, the dampes wherof
be such, that thei kil y<sup>e</sup> birdes flieng ouer them. Of
like dampes, I heard in the north country in cole pits,
wherby the laboring men be streight killed, except before
the houre of coming therof (which thei know by
y<sup>e</sup> flame of their candle) thei auoid the ground.
Thirdly by putrefaction or rot in groundes aftre great
flouddes, in carions &amp; in dead men. After great
fluddes, as happened in y<sup>e</sup> time of Gallien the Emperor
at Rome, in Achaia &amp; Libia, wher the seas sodeinly did
ouerflow y<sup>e</sup> cities nigh to y<sup>e</sup> same. And in the <span class="lowercase smcap">XI</span> yeare
of Pelagius, when al the flouddes throughe al Italye
didde rage, but chieflye Tibris at Rome, whiche in
many places was as highe as the walles of the citie.</p>

<p>In carions or dead bodies, as fortuned here in Englande
upon the sea banckes in the tyme of King Alured
or Alfrede (as some Chroniclers write) but in the time
of Ethelred after Sabellicus, by occasion of drowned
Locustes cast up by the Sea, which by a wynde were
driuen oute of Fraunce thether. This locust is a flie in
bignes of a manne’s thumbe, in colour broune, in shape<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
somewhat like a greshopper, hauing <span class="lowercase smcap">VI</span> fiete, so many
wynges, two tiethe, &amp; an hedde like a horse, and
therfore called in Italy Caualleto, where ouer y<sup>e</sup> citie
of Padoa, in the yere <span class="lowercase smcap">M.D.XIII.</span> (as I remembre,) I, with
manye more did see a swarme of theim, whose passage
ouer the citie, did laste two hours, in breadth inestimable
to euery man there. Here by example to note
infection by deadde menne in Warres . either in rotting
aboue the ground, as chaunced in Athenes by theim
of Ethiopia, or else in beyng buried ouerly as happened
at Bulloigne, in the yere <span class="lowercase smcap">M.D.XIV.</span> the yeare aftre
King Henrye theight had conquered the same, or by
long continuance of an hoste in one place, it is more
playne by dayly experience, then it neadeth to be
shewed.</p>

<p>Therefore I wil now go to the fourth especial cause
of infection, the pent aier, breaking out of the ground
in yearthquakes, as chaunced at Venice in the firste
yeare of Andrea Dandulo, then Duke, the <span class="lowercase smcap">XXIV</span> day of
Januarye, and <span class="lowercase smcap">XX</span> hour after their computacion. By
which infection mani died, &amp; many wer borne before
their time. The <span class="lowercase smcap">V</span> cause is close &amp; unstirred aire &amp;
therfore putrified or currupt, out of old welles, holes
in y<sup>e</sup> ground made for grain, wherof many I did se in
&amp; about Pesaro in Italy, by opening them aftre a great
space, as both those countrimen do confesse &amp; also by
example is declared, for y<sup>t</sup> manye in opening them unwarely
be killed. Out of caues and tombes also, as
chaunced first in the country of Babilonia, proceding<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
aftre into Grece, and so to Rome, by occasion that y<sup>e</sup>
souldiers of themperour Marcus Antoninus, upon hope
of money, brake up a golden coffine of Auidius Cassius,
spieng a little hole therin, in the temple of Apollo in
Seleucia, as Ammianus Marcellinus writeth. To these
mai be ioyned the particular causes of infection, which
I cal the accidentes of the place, augmenting the same.
As nigh to dwelling places, merishe &amp; muddy groundes,
puddles or donghilles, sinckes or canales, easing places
or carions, deadde ditches or rotten groundes, close
aier in houses or ualleis, with such like. Thus muche
for the firste cause.</p>

<p>The second cause of this Englyshe Ephemera, I said
were thimpure spirites in bodies corupt by repletion.
Repletion I cal here, abundance of humores euel &amp;
maliciouse, from long time by little and little gathered
by euel diete, remaining in the bodye, coming either
by to moche meate, or by euel meate in qualitie, as infected
frutes, meates of euel juse or nutriment: or both
ioyntly. To such spirites when the aire infective cometh
consonant, then be thei distempered, corrupted, sore
handled, &amp; oppressed, then nature is forced &amp; the
disease engendred. But while I doe declare these impure
spirites to be one cause, I must remoue your myndes from
spirites to humours, for that the spirites be fedde of the
finest partes therof, &amp; aftre bringe you againe to spirites
where I toke you. And for so muche as I haue not
yet forgotten to whome I write, in this declaration I
will leaue apart al learned &amp; subtil reasons, as here<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
void &amp; vnmiete &amp; only vse suche as be most euident
to whom I write, &amp; easiest to be understanden of the
same: and at ones therwith shew also why it haunteth
us Englishmen more then other nations. Therfore
I passe ouer the vngentle sauoure or smell of the sweate,
grosenes, colour, and other qualities of the same, the
quantitie, the daunger in stopping, the maner in coming
furthe redily, or hardly, hot or cold, the notes in the
excrementes, the state longer or sorer, with suche others,
which mai be tokens of corrupt humours &amp; spirites, &amp;
onli wil stand vpon <span class="lowercase smcap">III</span> reasons declaring y<sup>e</sup> same swet
by gret repletion to be in vs not otherwise for al y<sup>e</sup> euel
aire apt to this disease, more then other nations. For
as heraftre I wil shew, &amp; Galen confirmeth, our bodies
cannot suffre any thing or hurt by corrupt &amp; infectiue
causes, except ther be in them a certein mater prepared
apt &amp; like to receiue it, els if one were sick, al shuld be
sick, if in this countri, in al countries wher the infection
came, which thing we se doth not chance. For
touching the first reason, we se this sweting sicknes or
pestilent Ephemera to be oft in England, but neuer entreth
Scotland, (except the borders) albeit thei both be
joinctly within the compas of on sea. The same beginning
here, hath assailed Brabant &amp; the costes nigh
to it, but neuer passed Germany, where ones it was in
like facion as here, with great mortalitie, in the yere
<span class="lowercase smcap">M.D.XXIX.</span> Cause wherof none other there is naturall,
then the euell diet of these thre countryes whiche destroy
more meates and drynckes withoute al ordre, conueni<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>ent
time, reason, or necessitie, then either Scotlande,
or all other countries vnder the sunne, to the greate
annoiance of their owne bodies and wittes, hinderance
of theim which haue nede, and great dearth and scarcitie
in their common welthes. Wherfore if Esculapius
the inuentour of Phisike, y<sup>e</sup> sauer of men from death,
&amp; restorer to life, should returne again into this world,
he could not saue these sortes of men, hauing so moche
sweatyng stuffe, so many euill humoures laid by in store,
from this displeasante, feareful, &amp; pestilent disease: except
thei would learne a new lession, &amp; folowe a new
trade. For otherwise, neither the auoidyng of this countrie
(the seconde reason) nor fleying into others, (a commune
refuge in other diseases) wyll preserue us Englishe
men, as in this laste sweate is by experience well
proued in Cales, Antwerpe, and other places of Brabant,
wher only our contrimen ware sicke and none others,
except one or ii. others of thenglishe diete, which is
also to be noted. (Fol.&nbsp;13 to 17.)</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p>The thirde and laste reason is, y<sup>t</sup> they which had thys
sweat sore with perille or death, were either men of
welthe, ease &amp; welfare, or of the poorer sorte such as
wer idle persones, good ale drinkers, and Tavern-haunters.
For these, by y<sup>e</sup> great welfare of the one
sorte, and large drinkyng of thother, heped up in
their bodies moche euill matter: by their ease and
idlenes, coulde not waste and consume it. A confirmacion
of this is, that the laborouse and thinne dieted<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
people, either had it not, because they dyd eate but
litle to make the matter: or with no greate grefe and
danger, because they laboured out moche therof.
Wherefore upon small cause, necessarily must folowe
a small effecte. All these reasones go to this ende,
that persones of all countries of moderate and good
diete, escape thys Englishe Ephemera, and those be
onely vexed therewith, whiche be of immoderate and
euill diete. But why? for the euill humores and corrupte
aier alone? No . for then the pestilence and not
the swet should rise. For what then? for y<sup>e</sup> impure
spirites corrupte in theimselues and by the infectiue
aier. Why so? for that of impure and corrupte humores,
whether thei be blode or others, can rise none
other then impure spirites. For euery thynge is such
as that wherof it commeth. Now, that of the beste
and fineste of the blode, yea in corrupte bodies (whyche
beste is nought) these spirites be ingendred and fedde
I before expressed. Therfor who wyl haue them
pure and cleane, and himselfe free from sweat, muste
kepe a pure and cleane diete, and then he shall be
sure. (Fol.&nbsp;20 to 21.)</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p>Who that lustethe to lyue in quiete suretie, out of
the sodaine danger of this Englishe Ephemera, he aboue
all thynges, of litle and good muste eate &amp; spare not;
the last parte wherof wyl please well (I doubt not) us
Englishe men: the firste I thinke neuer a deale. Yet
it must please theim that intende to lyue without the<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
reche of this disease. So doyng they shall easely escape
it. For of that is good, can be engendred no
euill: of that is litle, can be gathered no great store.
Therfore helthful must he nedes be and free from this
disease, that vsethe this kinde of liuynge and maner in
dietynge. An example hereof may the wise man Socrates
be, which by this sorte of diete escaped a sore
pestilence in Athenes, neuer fleynge ne kepyng close
him selfe from the same. Truly who will lyue accordynge
to nature and not to lust, may with this diete be
well contented. For nature is pleased with a litle,
nor seketh other then that the mind voide of cares and
feares may be in quiete merily, and the body voide of
grefe, maye be in life swetly, as Lucretius writeth.
Here at large to ronne out vntill my breth wer spent,
as vpon a common place, against y<sup>e</sup> intemperance or
excessive diete of Englande, thincommodities &amp; displeasures
of the same many waies: and contrarie, in
commendation of meane diete and temperance (called
of Plato sophrosyne, for that it conserueth wisdome)
and the thousande commodities thereof, both for
helthe, welthe, witte and longe life, well I might, &amp;
lose my laboure: such be our Englishe facions rather
then reasones. But for that I purpose neither to wright
a longe worke but a shorte counseill, nor to wery the
reders with that they luste not to here, I will lette that
passe, and moue them that desire further to knowe my
mynde therin, to remember that I sayd before, of litle
&amp; good eate and spare not, wherby they shall easely<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
perceiue my meanyng. I therefore go furth with my
diete, wherin my counseill is, that the meates be helthfull,
and holsomly kylled, swetly saued, and wel prepared
in rostyng, sethyng, baking, &amp; so furth. The
bread of swet corne, wel leuened, &amp; so baked. The
drinke of swete malte and good water kyndly
brued, without other drosse now a daies used. No
wine in all the tyme of sweatyng, excepte to suche
whose sicknese require it for medicin, for fere of inflamynge
&amp; openynge, nor except y<sup>e</sup> halfe be wel soden
water. In other tymes old, pure &amp; smal. Wishing
for the better execution hereof &amp; ouersight of good and
helthsome victalles, ther wer appointed certein masters
of helth in euery citie and toune, as there is in Italie,
whiche for the good order in all thynges, maye be in al
places an example. The meates I would to be veale,
muttone, kidde, olde lambe, chikyn, capone, henne,
cocke, pertriche, phesane, felfare, smal birdes, pigeon,
yong pecockes, whose fleshe by a certeine natural &amp;
secrete propertie neuer putrefie, as hath bene proued.
Conies, porke of meane age, neither fatte nor leane,
the skynne taken awaye, roste &amp; eaten colde. Tartes
of prunes, gelies of veale &amp; capone. Yong befe in this
case a little poudered is not to be dispraised, nor new
egges &amp; good milke. Butter in a mornyng with sage
and rewe fastynge in the sweatynge time is a good preseruatiue,
beside that it nourisheth. Crabbes, crauesses,
picrel, perche ruffe, gogion, lampreis out of grauelly
riuers, smeltes, dace, barbell, gornerd, whityng, soles,<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
flunders, plaice, millers thumbes, minues w<sup>h</sup> such
others, sodde in water &amp; vinegre w<sup>h</sup> rosemary,
time, sage, &amp; hole maces, &amp; serued hote. Yea
swete salte fishe &amp; linge, for the saltes sake wastynge
y<sup>e</sup> humores therof, which in many freshe fishes
remaine, maye be allowed well watered to them that
haue non other &amp; wel lyke it. Nor all fishes, no more
then al fleshes be so euill as they be taken for: as is
wel declared in physik, &amp; approued by the olde and
wise romaines moche in their fisshes, lusty chartusianes
neuer in fleshes, &amp; helthful poore people more
in fishe than fleshe. But we are nowe a daies so
vnwisely fine, and womanly delicate, that we may in
no wise touch a fisshe. The olde manly hardnes,
stoute courage, and peinfulnes of Englande is vtterly
driuen awaye, in the stede wherof, men now a daies
receiue womanlines &amp; become nice, not able to withstande
a blaste of wynde, or resiste a poore fisshe.
And children be so brought up, that if they be not all
daie by the fire with a toste and butire, and in their
furres, they be streight sicke.</p>

<p>Sauces to metes I appoint firste aboue all thynges
good appetite, and next Oliues, capers, juse of lemones,
Barberies, Pomegranetes, Orenges and Sorel,
veriuse &amp; vineigre, iuse of unripe Grapes, thepes or
Goseberies. After mete, quinces, or marmalade, Pomgranates,
Orenges sliced eaten with Suger, Succate of

apples and peres, Brunes, Reisons Dates and Nuttes.<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
Figges also, so they be taken before diner, els no frutes

delyghte &amp; qualitie, tyme of the yeare, with other circumstaunces,

that euel which by your owne foly you vndiscretelye

me to write of euery particular estate and case, whiche
be so manye as there be menne, were so great almost

seke you out a good Phisicien and knowen to haue

you are to your hosen or shoes, for the wel making or

Almaine, Spaine, Fraunce, Grece and Turkie, Jude,

&amp; quienes, promising helpe of al diseases, yea vncurable,
with one or twoo drinckes, by waters sixe monethes in
continualle distillinge, by Aurum potabile, or quintessence,
by drynckes of great and hygh prices, as though

foolysh smokynges of shirtes Smockes and kerchieffes,
wyth suche others theire phantasies, and mockeryes,
meaninge nothinge els but to abuse your light belieue,
and scorne you behind your backes with their medicines
(so filthie, that I am ashamed to name them) for
your single wit and simple belief, in trusting them
most, whiche you know not at al, and understand least:
like to them whiche thinke, farre foules haue faire
fethers, althoughe thei be neuer so euel fauoured &amp;
foule: as thoughe there coulde not be so conning an
Englishman, as a foolish running stranger, (of others I
speake not) or so perfect helth by honest learning, as
by deceiptfull ignorance. For in the erroure of these
vnlearned reasteth the losse of youre honest estimation,
diere bloudde, precious spirites, and swiete lyfe, the
thyng of most estimation and price in this worlde, next
vnto the immortal soule.</p>

<p>For consuming of euel matter within, and for making
our bodies lustye, galiard, &amp; helthful, I do not
a litle commende exercise, whiche in vs Englishe
men I allowe quick, and liuishe: as to runne after<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
houndes and haukes, to shote, wrastle, play at Tennes
and weapons, tosse the winde balle, skirmishe at base
(an exercise for a gentlemanne, muche vsed among the
Italianes) and vaughting vpon an horse. Bowling, a good
exercise for women: castinge of the barre and camping,
I accompt rather a laming of legges, then an exercise.
Yet I vtterly reproue theim not, if the hurt may be
auoyded. For these a conueniente tyme is, before meate:
due measure, reasonable sweatinge, in al times of the
year, sauing in the sweatinge tyme. In the whiche I
allow rather quietnesse then exercise, for opening the
body, in suche persons specially as be liberally &amp; freely
brought up. Others, except sitting artificers, haue
theire exercises by daily labours in their occupations,
to whom nothing niedeth but solace onely, a thing conuenient
for euery bodye that lusteth to live in helth.
For els as non other thing, so not healthe canne be
longe durable.</p>

<p>Thus I speake of solace, that I meane not Idlenesse,
wisshing alwayes no man to be idle, but to be occupied
in some honest kinde of thing necessary in a common
welth. For I accompt them not worthie meate and
drink in a commonwelth, y<sup>t</sup> be not good for some
purpose or seruice therin, but take them rather as
burdennes vnprofitable and heauye to the yearth, men
borne to fille a numbre only, and wast the frutes which
therthe doeth geue, willing soner to fiede the Lacedemonians
old &amp; croked asse, whiche labored for the liuing
so long as it coulde for age, then suche an idle<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
Englisshe manne. If the honestye and profite of honeste
labour and exercise, conseruation of healthe, preseruation
from sickenesse, maintenaunce of lyfe, advauncement,
safety from shamefull deathes, defence from
beggerye, dyspleasures by idlenesse, shamefulle diseases
by the same, hatefulle vices, and punishmente
of the immortalle soule canne not moue vs to reasonable
laboure and exercise, and to be profitable membres of
the commune welthe, let at the least shame moue vs,
seyng that other country menne, of nought, by their
owne witte, diligence, labour and actiuitie, can picke
oute of a cast bone, a wrethen strawe, a lyghte fether,
or an hard stone, an honeste lyuinge: Nor ye shall
euer heare theym say, alas master, I haue non occupacion,
I must either begge or steale. For they can
finde other meanes betwene these two. And for so
muche as in the case that nowe is, miserable persons
are to be relieued in a common welth, I would wisshe
for not fauouring the idle, the discretion of Marc.
Cicero the romaine were vsed in healping them: who
wolde compassion should be shewed vpon them whome
necessitie compelled to do or make a faute: &amp; no compassion
vpon them, in whome a faulte made necessitie.
A faulte maketh necessitie, in this case of begging, in
them, whyche might laboure and serve &amp; wil not for
idlenes; and therefore not to be pitied, but rather to
be punished. Necessitie maketh a fault in them,
whiche wold labor and serue, but cannot for age, impotency,
or sickenes, and therefore to be pitied and<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
relieued. But to auoyde punishmente and to shew the
waye to amendmente, I woulde again wishe, y<sup>t</sup> for so
much as we be so euel disposed of ourselfes to our own
profites and comodities without help, this old law were
renued, which forbiddeth the nedy &amp; impotent parentes,
to be releued of those their welthi chyldren, that by
theym or theire meanes were not broughte vppe, eyther
in good learning and Science, or honeste occupation.
For so is a man withoute science, as a realme withoute
a kyng. (Fol.&nbsp;27 to 30.)</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p>Al these thinges duely obserued, and well executed,
whiche before I haue for preseruation mencioned, if
more ouer we can sette aparte al affections, as fretting
cares and thoughtes, dolefull or sorowfull imaginations,
vaine feares, folysh loues, gnawing hates, and geue
oure selues to lyue quietly, frendlie &amp; merily one with
an outher, as men were wont to do in the old world,
when this Countrie was called merye Englande, and
euery man to medle in his own matters, thinking theim
sufficient, as thei do in Italie, and auoyde malyce and
dissencion, the destruction of commune wealthes, and
priuate houses: I doubte not but we shall preserue our
selues, both from this sweatinge syckenesse, and
other diseases also not here purposed to be spoken of.

<i>Förstemann</i>, Loc. cit. The pilgrimages of the
Flagellants of the year 1349, were not the last.
Later in the 14th century, this fanaticism still manifested
itself several times, though never to so great
an extent: in the 15th century, it was deemed necessary,
in several parts of Germany, to extirpate them
by fire and sword;&mdash;and in the year 1710, processions
of the Cross-bearers were still seen in Italy. How
deep this mania had taken root, is proved by the deposition
of a citizen of Nordhäusen (1446): that his wife,
in the belief of performing a Christian act, wanted to
scourge her children, as soon as they were baptized.</p></div>

On this subject see <i>Königshoven</i>, who has preserved
very valuable original proceedings. The most important
are, the criminal examinations of ten Jews,
at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, held in September
and October, 1348.&mdash;V. Appendix. They produced
the most strange confessions, and sanctioned, by the
false name of justice, the blood-thirsty fanaticism
which lighted the funeral piles. Copies of these
proceedings were sent to Bern and Strasburg, where
they gave rise to the first persecutions against the
Jews.&mdash;V. also the original Document of the offensive
and defensive Alliance between <i>Berthold von Götz</i>,
Bishop of Strasburg, and many powerful lords and
nobles, in favor of the city of Strasburg, against
Charles IV. The latter saw himself compelled, in consequence,
to grant to that city an amnesty for the
Jewish persecutions, which in our days would be
deemed disgraceful to an imperial crown. Not to
mention many other documents, which no less clearly
shew the spirit of the 14th century, p.&nbsp;1021. f.</p></div>

It is worthy of note, and quite in conformity

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
